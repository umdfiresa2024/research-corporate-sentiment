table of contents research and patents​research and product development constitutes an important part of 3m’s activities and has been a major driver of 3m’s sales and profit growth. research, development and related expenses totaled $1.911 billion in 2019, $1.821 billion in 2018 and $1.870 billion in 2017. research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion in 2019, $1.253 billion in 2018 and $1.352 billion in 2017. related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in r&d-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.​the company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. the company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. the actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.​the company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. in general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company’s business segments.​raw materials​in 2019, the company experienced raw material price inflation across many material markets in all geographies. in response, the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. these succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. to date, the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. in addition, 3m evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.​environmental law compliance​3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3m has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 16, commitments and contingencies).​environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.​in 2019, 3m expended approximately $59 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. the company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. while capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be approximately $150 million to $220 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions, 3m cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of 7

table of contents the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.​forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the headings of “overview,” “financial condition and liquidity,” and annually in “critical accounting estimates.” discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of part ii, item 7, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.” for additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on form 10-k, 10-q and 8-k filed with the sec from time to time.​item 1a. risk factors​provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company. discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part i, item 2, “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.”​* results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, capital markets and other external conditions. the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states. the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and has been and will in the future be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters, including public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates. natural occurrences and human activities are increasingly releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.​* the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.as previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company, collectively known as “pfas.” the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. these characteristics have made pfas critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. they are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology. pfas compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3m, and are used in everyday products. as science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (pfoa) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) globally as a precautionary measure. we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the u.s. completed by the end of 2002. phased out products included aqueous film forming foam (afff) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfas-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in note 16, “commitments and contingencies,” within the notes to consolidated financial statements. an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. for example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater, surface 10
table of contents water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise. ​* the company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws, u.s. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and similar foreign agencies, u.s. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the false claims act, anti-kickback laws, the sunshine act, or other matters. the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. although the company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. in addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety matters involving the company may negatively impact the company’s reputation. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in note 16, “commitments and contingencies,” within the notes to consolidated financial statements.​* the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. demand for the company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.​* foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. because the company’s financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states, the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.​* the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. this ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.​* the company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. the company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated. any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.​11
table of contents * the company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an erp system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation. in the ordinary course of business, the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. additionally, the company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service or cloud provider breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of vulnerabilities to the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the company. there may be other challenges and risks as the company upgrades and standardizes its erp system on a worldwide basis. any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruptions or shutdowns, and damage to the company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the company’s business. although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.​* acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of acelity, inc. and its kci subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. the company realigned from five to four business segments, effective in april of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. successful execution of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important to the company’s future results.​* the company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. the company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. this is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system. there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. operational challenges, including those related to productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial conditions and results of operations.​* the company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results. the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.​* change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital. the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m. this evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service and has an aa- credit rating with standard & poor’s; standard & poor’s

table of contents charge of $134 million and second quarter 2019 pre-tax charge of $148 million, which when combined, resulted in a full year 2019 impact of 41 cents per diluted share. see note 5 for additional details. ​acquisitions/divestitures:●acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of m*modal (first quarter 2019), and acelity (fourth quarter 2019). these items collectively decreased earnings per diluted share by 19 cents year-on-year for 2019. the net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. interest expense related to financing costs of these acquisitions is also included. expenses related to the october 2019 acquisition of acelity also include financing costs and the tax effect of repatriating funds in advance of the close of the acquisition.●divestiture impacts include the incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestitures and the lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the divestiture of the communication markets division). these items collectively increased earnings per diluted share by 16 cents year-on-year for 2019. the net impacts included 14 cents for 2019 related to the gain from the third quarter 2019 divestiture of the company’s gas and flame detection business and 7 cents from the second quarter 2019 “held for sale” tax benefit related to the legal entities associated with the divestiture. other incremental year-on-year gains/losses on divestitures and the lost operating income from divested businesses decreased earnings per share by 5 cents for 2019.●in addition to divestiture impacts above, remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the 2018 divestiture of the communication markets division decreased earnings per diluted share by 4 cents year-on-year for 2019.​foreign exchange impacts:●foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. ​income tax rate:●certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. overall, the effective tax rate for 2019 was 19.8 percent, a decrease of 3.6 percentage points versus 2018. on an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate decreased 0.5 percentage points year-on-year for 2019.●factors that decreased the effective tax rate on a gaap basis for 2019 included prior year measurement period adjustments related to 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), prior year resolution of the nrd lawsuit (as described in note 16) and geographical income mix. these decreases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of the venezuelan subsidiary, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, and significant litigation-related charges. refer to note 10 for additional details.​shares of common stock outstanding:●lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share year-on-year by 22 cents per diluted share for 2019. weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2019 declined 2.8 percent year-on-year which benefited earnings per share. the decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the company’s purchase of $1.4 billion of its own stock in 2019.​year 2018 eps:​2017 divestiture of identity management business:●in may 2017, 3m completed the divestiture of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain of $457 million, which was reported within the company’s transportation and electronics business.​organic growth/productivity and other:●2018 year-on-year benefits include higher organic local-currency sales, selling price increases, and business transformation, which had a positive impact on 3m’s productivity efforts. higher raw material costs partially offset these year-on-year benefits.●lower year-on-year restructuring (other than activity related to the communication markets division divestiture), portfolio and footprint actions increased pre-tax earnings by approximately $307 million in 2018. 2017 charges included $99 million in restructuring actions and $207 million in asset charges, accelerated depreciation and other costs.●interest expense (net of interest income) increased $8 million year-on-year. while 2017 interest expense included a $96 million early debt extinguishment charge, 2018 net interest expense increased as a result of higher u.s. average debt balances and higher borrowing costs.18
table of contents ●on a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense, in addition to lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense, increased expense year-on-year. ​acquisitions/other divestiture gains:●in aggregate, acquisitions, year-on-year divestitures gains (other than the sale of the communication markets division and identity management business), and lost operating income from divested businesses (other than lost income related to the divestiture of the communication markets division) decreased earnings per diluted share by 10 cents in 2018.●remaining stranded costs and lost operating income related to the divestiture of the communication markets division decreased earnings per diluted share by 5 cents year-on-year in 2018.​foreign exchange impacts:●foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings year-on-year by approximately $42 million, or the equivalent of 5 cents per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. ​income tax rate:●certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. the effective tax rate for full year 2018 was 23.4 percent, a decrease of 12.1 percentage points versus 2017. on an adjusted basis (as described below), the effective income tax rate was 20.1 percent for 2018 versus 25.4 percent for 2017. ●factors that decreased the effective tax rate on a gaap basis for 2018 primarily related to the favorable aspects of the tcja such as the decrease in the u.s. income tax rate and foreign-derived intangible income (fdii), reduced transitional impact of tcja related to transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities and increased benefits from the r&d tax credit. these decreases were partially offset by the elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction, the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) provision, and lower excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments. refer to note 10 for additional details.​shares of common stock outstanding:●lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share by 18 cents per diluted share for full year 2018. weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2018 declined 1.8 percent year-on-year, which benefited earnings per share. the decrease in the outstanding weighted-average diluted shares relates to the company’s purchase of $4.9 billion of its own stock in the 2018.​2018 divestiture of communication markets division, net of related restructuring actions and exit activities:●as discussed above, in 2018, 3m completed the sale of substantially all of its communication markets division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $509 million as a result of this divestiture. the divestiture was reported within the company’s safety and industrial business. also as discussed above, during 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the communication markets division divestiture that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $127 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates. the aggregate net impact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 50 cents per diluted share for 2018. ​certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary, and enactment/measurement period adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) - (non-gaap measures):​in 2019, the company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to pfas (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. the aggregate 2019 pre-tax charge was reflected in cost of sales ($328 million) and selling, general and administrative expense ($434 million). in 2018, 3m recorded significant litigation-related charges of $897 million ($770 million after tax) for pfas matters related to the previously disclosed agreement reached with the state of minnesota that resolved the natural resource damages (nrd) lawsuit. essentially all of the aggregate 2018 pre-tax charge was reflected in selling, general and administrative expense. these charges are further discussed in note 16.​in the second quarter of 2019, 3m recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to the deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary as further discussed in note 1.​19
table of contents with respect to the enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), 3m recorded a $762 million tax expense in 2017 and additional net tax expense of $176 million in 2018 as a measurement period adjustment to the tcja’s enactment. see note 10 for details.​in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap, the company also provides non-gaap measures that adjust for the impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan subsidiary and measurement period adjustments to the enactment of the tcja. these items represent significant amounts that impacted the company’s financial results. operating income, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate are all measures for which 3m provides the reported gaap measure and an adjusted measure. the adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, gaap measures. the company considers these non-gaap measures in evaluating and managing the company’s operations. the company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. the determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)​​operating income​operating income margin​​​income before taxes​​provision for income taxes​effective tax rate​​​net income attributable to 3m​​earnings per diluted share​earnings per diluted share percent change​full year 2017 gaap​$ 7,692​ 24.3%​$ 7,548​$ 2,679​ 35.5%​$ 4,858​$ 7.93​​​adjustment for tcja enactment ​​​​​​​​​​ (762)​​​​​ 762​​ 1.24​​​full year 2017 adjusted amounts (non-gaap measures)​$ 7,692​ 24.3%​$ 7,548​$ 1,917​ 25.4%​$ 5,620​$ 9.17​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​full year 2018 gaap​$ 7,207​ 22.0%​$ 7,000​$ 1,637​ 23.4%​$ 5,349​$ 8.89​ 12.1%adjustment for significant litigation-related charges​​ 897​​​​​ 897​​ 127​​​​​ 770​​ 1.28​​​adjustment for measurement period accounting for tcja ​​​​​​​​​​ (176)​​​​​ 176​​ 0.29​​​full year 2018 adjusted amounts (non-gaap measures)​$ 8,104​ 24.7%​$ 7,897​$ 1,588​ 20.1%​$ 6,295​$ 10.46​ 14.1%​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​full year 2019 gaap $ 6,174​ 19.2%​$ 5,712​$ 1,130​ 19.8%​$ 4,570​$ 7.81​ (12.1)%adjustment for significant litigation-related charges​​ 762​​​​​ 762​​ 172​​​​​ 590​​ 1.01​​​adjustment for loss on deconsolidation of venezuelan subsidiary​​​​​​​​ 162​​ —​​​​​ 162​​ 0.28​​​full year 2019 adjusted amounts(non-gaap measures) $ 6,936​ 21.6%​$ 6,636​$ 1,302​ 19.6%​$ 5,322​$ 9.10​ (13.0)%​​20

table of contents largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. in either case, 3m’s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3m’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.​financial condition: ​3m generated $7.070 billion of operating cash flow in 2019, an increase of $631 million when compared to 2018. this increase was primarily due to significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments that impacted 2019 and 2018. this followed an operating cash flow increase of $199 million when comparing 2018 to 2017. refer to the section entitled “financial condition and liquidity” later in md&a for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. ​in november 2018, 3m’s board of directors replaced the company’s february 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. this new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. in 2019, the company purchased $1.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $4.9 billion in 2018 and $2.1 billion in 2017. the company expects to purchase approximately $1.0 billion of its own stock in 2020. in february 2020, 3m’s board of directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of $1.47 per share, an increase of 2 percent. this marked the 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m. ​raw materials:​in 2019, the company experienced raw material price inflation across many material markets in all geographies. in response, the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. these succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. to date, the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. in addition, 3m evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.​pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:​on a worldwide basis, 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2019. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 93 percent funded and the international pension plans were 87 percent funded. the u.s. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. asset returns in 2019 for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan were 16.3%, as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2020 is 6.75%. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan year-end 2019 discount rate was 3.25%, down 1.11 percentage points from the year-end 2018 discount rate of 4.36%. the decrease in u.s. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (pbo). the primary u.s. qualified pension plan’s funded status decreased 3 percentage points in 2019 due to the higher pbo resulting from the significant discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets. additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in note 13 (pension and postretirement benefit plans).​3m expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2020. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2020. 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2020 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $34 million pre-tax when compared to 2019. refer to “critical accounting estimates” within md&a and note 13 (pension and postretirement benefit plans) for additional information concerning 3m’s pension and post-retirement plans.​​24
table of contents 2020 closed and recently announced divestitures:​as discussed in note 3, in december 2019, 3m agreed to sell substantially all of its drug delivery business for approximately $650 million in consideration, subject to closing and other adjustments. 3m expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $400 million as a result of the divestiture that will be reported within the company’s health care business. the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2020.​also as discussed in note 3, in january 2020, 3m completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business for $91 million, subject to closing and other adjustments, plus contingent consideration of up to $25 million depending on the outcome of pending tenders. the company previously reflected an immaterial impact in 2019 as a result of measuring the disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.​results of operations​net sales:​refer to the preceding “overview” section and the “performance by business segment” section later in md&a for additional discussion of sales change.​operating expenses:​​​​​​​​​​​​​    ​    ​    ​    ​    ​ ​​​​​​​​2019 versus ​2018 versus ​(percent of net sales)​2019​2018​2017​2018​2017 cost of sales   53.4%   50.9%   50.8%   2.5%   0.1%selling, general and administrative expenses  21.9​ 23.2​ 20.9​ (1.3)​ 2.3​research, development and related expenses  5.9​ 5.6​ 5.9​ 0.3​ (0.3)​gain on sale of businesses​ (0.4)​ (1.7)​ (1.9)​ 1.3​ 0.2​operating income margin  19.2%   22.0%   24.3%   (2.8)%   (2.3)%​operating income margins decreased year over year for both 2019 and 2018. the decrease from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by softness in certain end markets and channel inventory adjustments, along with actions taken by 3m in response to lower sales volumes and high inventory levels, which resulted in lower manufacturing and inventory absorption. additionally, higher year-on-year restructuring actions taken decreased operating income margins, partially offset by lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges. the decrease from 2017 to 2018 was driven primarily by the charge related to the significant litigation-related charges (as discussed in the selling, general and administrative expenses section below). a number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, portfolio and footprint actions, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement service cost effects. expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. pension and postretirement service cost expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a); and research, development and related expenses (r&d). in total, 3m’s defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense decreased $58 million in 2019, compared to an increase of $21 million in 2018. refer to note 13 (pension and postretirement plans) for the service cost components of net periodic benefit costs.​the company is investing in an initiative called business transformation, with these investments impacting cost of sales, sg&a, and r&d. business transformation encompasses the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system on a worldwide basis, as well as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3m.​cost of sales:​cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. ​cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased during full year 2019 when compared to full year 2018. increases primarily related to lower sales volume year-on-year, which resulted in cost absorption penalties from lower sales volumes as all businesses worked to reduce inventories and improve cash flow and significant litigation-related charges taken in 2019 (as discussed earlier in the certain amounts adjusted for impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the company’s venezuelan 25

table of contents legal proceedings:​assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. the company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and estimable in accordance with accounting standard codification (asc) 450, contingencies. please refer to the section entitled “process for disclosure and recording of liabilities related to legal proceedings” (contained in “legal proceedings” in note 16) for additional information about such estimates.​pension and postretirement obligations:​the company makes certain estimates and judgements in relation to its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations. ​the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.​using this methodology, the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:​​​​​​​​​​u.s. qualified pension    international pension (weighted average)    u.s. postretirement medical​december 31, 2019 liability:​​​​​​​benefit obligation​ 3.25% 1.81% 3.13%2020 net periodic benefit cost components:​​​​​​​service cost​ 3.44% 1.61% 3.35%interest cost​ 2.88% 1.61% 2.73%​another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. the expected return on plan assets for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2020 is 6.75%, a decrease from 7.00% in 2019. return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 4.70% for 2020, compared to 4.90% for 2019. refer to note 13 for information on how the 2019 rates were determined.​3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures in determining the fair value of plan assets within the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. see note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.​for the year ended december 31, 2019, the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $425 million and a benefit of $68 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $357 million, down from $410 million in 2018. ​in 2020, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $458 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is 38

company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain long-lived assets. those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.​acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets​in conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. the corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. the fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. as a result, the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.​assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill​as of december 31, 2019, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.3 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $6.4 billion, of which $0.6 billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. in addition, 3m goodwill totaled approximately $13.4 billion as of december 31, 2019. long-lived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. if an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. if future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3m would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. for instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. these risk factors are discussed in item 1a, “risk factors,” of this document. in addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.39
table of contents ​as of december 31, 2019, the $0.6 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to capital safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to note 4 for more detail). the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2019, no impairment was indicated. the discounted cash flows related to the capital safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate.​3m goodwill totaled approximately $13.4 billion as of december 31, 2019. 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. at 3m, reporting units correspond to a division. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3m typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. where applicable, 3m used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.​as described in note 19, effective in the second quarter of 2019, the company realigned its former five business segments into four to enable the company to better serve global customers and markets. in addition, effective in the first quarter of 2019, 3m made business segment reporting changes to align its businesses around markets and customers. for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. during both the first and second quarters of 2019, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2019 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.​based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2019, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. as of october 1, 2019, 3m had 23 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 91 percent of the goodwill. these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: advanced materials, display materials and systems, electronics materials solutions, health information systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, medical solutions, oral care solutions, personal safety, separation and purification sciences, and transportation safety.​3m is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. ​3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2020 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.​uncertainty in income tax positions:​the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. the company follows guidance provided by asc 740, income taxes, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to note 10 for additional 40
table of contents information). the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.​new accounting pronouncements​information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.​financial condition and liquidity​the strength and stability of 3m’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. investing in 3m’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3m will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. sources for cash availability in the united states, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding u.s. acquisitions and other items as needed. the tcja creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3m to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support u.s. capital deployments needs. for those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for u.s. operations. see note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely. ​3m’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and u.s. commercial paper issuances. 3m believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3m’s commercial paper program permits the company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. at december 31, 2019, there was approximately $150 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.​total debt:​the strength of 3m’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3m proven access to capital markets. additionally, the company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service and has an aa- credit rating with standard & poor’s; standard & poor’s placed 3m on “creditwatch negative” in january 2020. ​the company’s total debt was $5.7 billion higher at december 31, 2019 when compared to december 31, 2018. increases in debt related to the first quarter and third quarter 2019 issuances of $2.25 billion of medium-term notes and $3.25 billion of other registered notes, respectively, in addition to the 69 billion japanese yen (approximately $632 million at december 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding from the 80 billion japanese yen credit facility established in september 2019 and the 150 million euro (approximately $168 million at december 31, 2019 exchange rates) outstanding credit facility established in november 2019. total debt also increased as a result of debt assumed from the october 2019 acelity inc. acquisition that was not settled at close as discussed below. these increases were partially offset by the june 2019 repayment of $625 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured in addition to lower commercial paper outstanding. for discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “cash flows from financing activities” section.​in conjunction with the october 2019 acquisition of acelity inc. of the debt assumed, 3m did not immediately settle at close $0.5 billion of notes and, instead, satisfied and discharged those notes via an in-substance defeasance. refer to note 12 for additional information.​in july 2017, the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the london interbank offered rate (“libor”) after 2021. the company is in the process of reviewing its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments and commercial contracts that utilize libor as the reference rate. 3m will continue its impact assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period. 41

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements​note 1. significant accounting policies​consolidation: 3m is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. all applicable subsidiaries are consolidated. all intercompany transactions are eliminated. as used herein, the term “3m” or “company” refers to 3m company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.​basis of presentation: certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.​foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the united states with the exception of 3m’s subsidiaries in argentina, the economy of which was considered highly inflationary beginning in 2018, and accordingly the financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.​3m had a consolidating subsidiary in venezuela, the financial statements of which were remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent because venezuela’s economic environment is considered highly inflationary. the operating income of this subsidiary was immaterial as a percent of 3m’s consolidated operating income for the periods presented. in light of circumstances, including the country’s unstable environment and heightened unrest leading to sustained lack of demand, and expectation that these circumstances will continue for the foreseeable future, during may 2019, 3m concluded it no longer met the criteria of control in order to continue consolidating its venezuelan operations. as a result, as of may 31, 2019, the company began reflecting its interest in the venezuelan subsidiary as an equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. this resulted in a pre-tax charge of $162 million within other expense (income) in the second quarter of 2019. the charge primarily relates to $144 million of foreign currency translation losses associated with foreign currency movements before venezuela was accounted for as a highly inflationary economy and pension elements previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with write-down of intercompany receivable and investment balances associated with this subsidiary. beginning may 31, 2019, 3m’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations no longer include the venezuelan entity’s operations other than an immaterial equity investment and associated loss or income thereon largely only to the extent, if any, that 3m provides support or materials and receives funding or dividends.​use of estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates.​cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.​marketable securities: marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (fifo) method. the classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3m reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by asc 320, investments-debt and equity securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”. a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity. such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. the factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors. amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or “other-than-temporary” impairment.​investments: all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3m utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not 61
table of contents have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. the balance of these securities is disclosed in note 7.​other assets: other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term assets. investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in “purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,” respectively.​inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (nrv), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation market. cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.​property, plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.​conditional asset retirement obligations: a liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the company. the obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. the asset retirement obligation liability was $137 million and $122 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.​goodwill: goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “step 0”. 3m has chosen not to apply step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.​intangible assets: intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from four to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. the estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between twelve to nineteen years, patents largely between six to seventeen years, other technology-based largely between six to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames largely between six and twenty years, and other intangibles largely between five to thirteen years. intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated 62
table of contents amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. refer to note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the company’s intangible assets. costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within “research, development and related expenses.”​intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. if an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.​intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.​restructuring actions: restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. these charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ remaining service periods. contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company. asset impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.​revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. the vast majority of 3m’s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. however, to a limited extent 3m also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.​the company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of accounting standards codification (asc) 606, revenue from contracts with customers. revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. for the majority of the company’s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfers to the customer. in limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3m completes the performance obligation(s).​revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the company expects to be entitled. when determining the transaction price, 3m estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under asc 606. the main sources of variable consideration for 3m are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. these sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. the most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. the range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. because 3m serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. there are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3m primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. the company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.63
table of contents ​for substantially all arrangements recognized over time, the company applies the “right to invoice” practical expedient. as a result, 3m recognizes revenue at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the company’s performance completed to date.​for contracts with multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3m’s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.​the company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.​the company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. additionally, the company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.​3m applies asc 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:●exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less.●practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. ●portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration.●“right to invoice” practical expedient based on 3m’s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3m’s performance completed to date.●election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.●sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required remaining performance obligations disclosure​the company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in light of the guidance of asc 842, leases. the company recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. the leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.​accounts receivable and allowances: trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. the company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. the allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. the company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. the company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. the company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.​advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $348 million in 2019, $396 million in 2018 and $411 million in 2017.​research, development and related expenses: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of income. research, development and related expenses totaled $1.911 billion in 2019, $1.821 billion in 2018 and $1.870 billion in 2017. research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion in 2019, $1.253 billion in 2018 and $1.352 billion in 2017. related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in r&d-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.​internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software’s use. amounts are reported as a component 64
table of contents of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.​environmental: environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.​income taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had valuation allowances of $158 million and $67 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. the company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under asc 740, income taxes. as described in the “new accounting pronouncements” section, 3m adopted asu no. 2018-02, reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. the company’s accounting policy for income taxes has been updated to indicate the uses of the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss.​earnings per share: the difference in the weighted average 3m shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the company’s stock-based compensation plans. certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (8.9 million average options for 2019, 2.9 million average options for 2018, and 0.8 million average options for 2017). the computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 follow:​earnings per share

stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (rsus), performance shares, and the general employees’ stock purchase plan (gespp). under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. however, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for rsus), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. these excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. the extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3m stock price and timing/extent of rsu vestings and employee stock option exercises. ​comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on 65
table of contents available-for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments. the company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.​derivatives and hedging activities: all derivative instruments within the scope of asc 815, derivatives and hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.​credit risk: the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. however, the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3m enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. a master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3m entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3m has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.​fair value measurements: 3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. the standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.​acquisitions: the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805, business combinations. this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting. in addition to business combinations, 3m periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. these transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity. ​66
table of contents leases: 3m determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. the right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3m determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3m does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. examples of such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.​after adoption of asu 2016-02 and related standards, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. the discount rate used to calculate present value is 3m’s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3m determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.​as a lessee, the company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. certain 3m lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3m’s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.​certain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3m includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the company will exercise the option. in addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. in general, 3m is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.​for the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3m groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancelable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. certain 3m leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.​new accounting pronouncements​in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu no. 2016-02, leases, and in july 2018, issued asu no. 2018-10 and 2018-11 and in december 2018, issued asu no. 2018-20 and in march 2019, issued asu no. 2019-01, which amended the standard, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. the new standard introduced a lessee model that requires entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. the asu did not make fundamental changes to previous lessor accounting. however, it modified what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related accounting and aligned a number of the underlying principles with those of the asc 606 revenue standard, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. the guidance eliminated existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. for 3m, the asu was effective january 1, 2019. as amended, the asu provided for retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods presented. 3m did not recast prior periods as it adopted this asu. as a result of adopting this asu, 3m recorded approximately $0.8 billion of lease assets and lease liabilities related to its operating leases and a $14 million adjustment to retained earnings related to transition upon this asu’s adoption.​in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which revises guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and in november 2018, issued asu no. 2018-19 and in april 2019, issued asu no. 2019-04 and in may 2019, issued asu no. 2019-05, and in november 2019, issued asu no. 2019-11, which amended the standard. the new standard introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. the new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. with respect to available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, the asu amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model. for such securities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a reduction in income. however, rather than also reflecting that 67
table of contents credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that afs debt security, the asu requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. as a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. for 3m, this asu is effective january 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. entities are required to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. based on the conducted analyses and due to the nature and extent of 3m’s financial instruments in scope of this asu (primarily accounts receivable) and the historical, current and expected credit quality of its customers, the company does not expect this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.​in august 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-12, targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities and in october 2018, issued asu no. 2018-16, which amended the standard. the asu amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow companies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to qualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. while an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge relationship is highly effective would still be required, the new asu permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative test and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. the asu also simplifies related accounting by eliminating the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. instead, for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges, the entire change in fair value (including the amount attributable to ineffectiveness) will be recorded within other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. for fair value hedges, generally, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument would also be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. the new standard also simplifies the accounting for fair value hedges of interest rate risks and expands an entity’s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components. in addition, the guidance also eases certain documentation requirements, modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and requires additional tabular disclosures of derivative and hedge-related information. for 3m, this asu was effective january 1, 2019, with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on 3m’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.​in february 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-02, reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, which permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) arising from the change in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017. an entity that elects to make this reclassification must consider all items in aoci that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as well as the entity’s policy for releasing income tax effects from aoci. the asu may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period of adoption. for 3m, this asu was effective january 1, 2019 and resulted in a reclassification between retained earnings and aoci. as a result of adopting this asu, the company increased retained earnings by approximately $0.9 billion, with an offsetting increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the same amount.​in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-15, customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract, which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e. hosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in asc 350-40, internal-use software. the asu permits either a prospective or retrospective transition approach. for 3m, the asu is effective as of january 1, 2020 and the company plans on prospective adoption. while the company utilized limited cloud-computing services where significant implementation costs were incurred for the periods presented, 3m will apply this asu to its expected expanded use of applicable services.​in december 2019, the fasb issued asu no. 2019-12, simplifying the accounting for income taxes (topic 740). this asu simplifies the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain existing exceptions related to the general approach in asc 740 relating to franchise taxes, reducing complexity in the interim-period accounting for year-to-date loss limitations and changes in tax laws, and clarifying the accounting for transactions outside of business combination that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. the transition requirements are primarily prospective and the effective date for 3m is january 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. as 3m does not have material activity associated with items such as franchise taxes or the types of transactions described above, does not typically have entities subject to relevant loss limitations and is not currently addressing 68

table of contents the company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $14 billion of undistributed earnings from non-u.s. subsidiaries as of december 31, 2019 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. because of the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.​note 11. marketable securities and held-to-maturity debt securities​marketable securities​the company invests in asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities. the following is a summary of amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for marketable securities (current and non-current).​​​​​​​​​(millions)​december 31, 2019​december 31, 2018 commercial paper ​$ 85​$ 366​certificates of deposit/time deposits ​  10​  10​u.s. municipal securities​  3​  3​asset-backed securities​​ —​​ 1​current marketable securities​$ 98​$ 380​​​​​​​​​u.s. municipal securities ​$ 43​$ 37​non-current marketable securities​$ 43​$ 37​​​​​​​​​total marketable securities​$ 141​$ 417​​at december 31, 2019 and 2018, gross unrealized, gross realized, and net realized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were not material.​the balance at december 31, 2019, for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below. actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.​​​​​​(millions)    december 31, 2019 due in one year or less ​$ 98​due after one year through five years ​  14​due after five years through ten years ​  20​due after ten years ​  9​total marketable securities ​$ 141​​held-to-maturity debt securities​in connection with the in-substance debt defeasance of the third lien notes described in note 12, the company purchased a $0.5 billion u.s. treasury security in the fourth quarter of 2019 that matures in the second quarter of 2020 and transferred it to a trust with irrevocable instructions to use the proceeds from its maturity to satisfy the redemption of the third lien notes in may 2020. this debt security is considered held-to-maturity due to the restrictions in satisfying and discharging the third lien notes, is carried at amortized cost, and is reflected in other current assets on the company’s consolidated balance sheet. at december 31, 2019, the difference between the amortized cost of the u.s. treasury security and its fair value was not material.​85

retirement or termination. the primary u.s. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1, 2009. the company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its u.s. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the company and were employed by the company prior to january 1, 2016. most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. the cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with u.s. amounts in the tables that follow.​the company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. for its u.s. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.​the company also sponsors employee savings plans under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. these plans are offered to substantially all regular u.s. employees. for eligible employees hired prior to january 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. employees hired on or after january 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. all contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. employer contributions to the u.s. defined contribution plans were $186 million, $173 million and $159 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 3m subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $96

retired by july 1, 2019 received an enhanced pension benefit. pension benefits were enhanced by adding one additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. 89
table of contents approximately 800 participants accepted the offer and retired before july 1, 2019. as a result, the company incurred a $35 million charge related to these special termination benefits in the second quarter of 2019.​in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company recognized a non-operating $32 million settlement expense in its u.s. non-qualified pension plan. the charge is related to lump sum payments made to employees at retirement. the settlement expense is an accelerated recognition of past actuarial losses.​in may 2019, 3m modified the 3m retiree life insurance plan postretirement benefit to close it to new participants effective august 1, 2019 (which results in employees who retire on or after august 1, 2019 not being eligible to participate in the plan) and reducing the maximum life insurance and death benefit to $8,000 for deaths on or after august 1, 2019. due to these changes, the plan was re-measured in the second quarter of 2019, resulting in a decrease to the accumulated projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $150 million and a related increase to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated other comprehensive income in addition to an immaterial income statement benefit prospectively.​the following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 of the respective years. 3m also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. the obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $40 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​qualified and non-qualified​​​​​​ ​​pension benefits​postretirement ​​united states​international​benefits (millions)    2019    2018    2019    2018    2019    2018 change in benefit obligation​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​benefit obligation at beginning of year​$ 15,948​$ 17,360​$ 6,965​$ 7,502​$ 2,175​$ 2,410​acquisitions/transfers​  —​  —​  9​  (11)​  —​  —​service cost ​  251​  288​  131​  143​  43​  52​interest cost ​  620​  563​  156​  157​  82​  79​participant contributions​  —​  —​  7​  9​  —​  —​foreign exchange rate changes​  —​  —​  55​  (387)​  —​  (13)​plan amendments​  —​  —​  3​  7​  (171)​  —​actuarial (gain) loss​  2,209​  (1,226)​  906​  (144)​  225​  (244)​benefit payments​  (1,128)​  (1,034)​  (302)​  (304)​  (112)​  (109)​settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other​  35​  (3)​  1​  (7)​​ —​  —​benefit obligation at end of year​$ 17,935​$ 15,948​$ 7,931​$ 6,965​$ 2,242​$ 2,175​change in plan assets​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​fair value of plan assets at beginning of year​$ 14,803​$ 15,686​$ 6,170​$ 6,737​$ 1,260​$ 1,397​acquisitions/transfers​​ —​​ (4)​​ 4​​ —​​ —​​ —​actual return on plan assets​  2,323​  (95)​  858​  (38)​  187​  (32)​company contributions​  101​  254​  106​  112​  3​  4​participant contributions​  —​  —​  7​  9​  —​  —​foreign exchange rate changes​  —​  —​  80​  (346)​  —​  —​benefit payments​  (1,128)​  (1,034)​  (302)​  (304)​  (112)​  (109)​settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other​  —​  (4)​ —​  —​  —​  —​fair value of plan assets at end of year​$ 16,099​$ 14,803​$ 6,923​$ 6,170​$ 1,338​$ 1,260​funded status at end of year​$ (1,836)​$ (1,145)​$ (1,008)​$ (795)​$ (904)​$ (915)​​​​90

table of contents the company provides eligible retirees in the u.s. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. the contributions provided by the company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to january 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after january 1, 2016. therefore, the company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.​the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. using this methodology, the company determined a discount rate of 3.25% for the u.s. pension plans and 3.27% for the postretirement benefit plans as of december 31, 2019, which is a decrease of 1.11 percentage points and 1.14 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of december 31, 2018. a decrease in the discount rate increases the projected benefit obligation (pbo), the significant decrease in the discount rate as of december 31, 2019 resulted in an approximately $2.0 billion higher pbo for the u.s. pension plans. for the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. if the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. in countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields. ​the company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.​for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.00% in 2019. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. as of december 31, 2019, the company’s 2020 expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is 6.75%. the expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. the 2019 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 23% global equities, 14% private equities, 47% fixed-income securities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. the actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2019 was 16.3%. in 2018 the plan earned a rate of return of -0.5% and in 2017 earned a return of 12.4%. the average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 8.9% and 9.4%, respectively. return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. ​as of december 31, 2019, the company converted to the “pri-2012 aggregate mortality table” and updated the mortality improvement scales to the society of actuaries scale mp-2019. the december 31, 2019 update resulted in a small decrease to the u.s. pension pbo and u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.​during 2019, the company contributed $207 million to its u.s. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. during 2018, the company contributed $366 million to its u.s. and international pension plans and $4 million to its postretirement plans. in 2020, the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its u.s. and international retirement plans. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2020. future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.​93

table of contents u.s. pension plans and postretirement benefit plan assets​in order to achieve the investment objectives in the u.s. pension plans and u.s. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target strategic asset allocation. the investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. the portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. the allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. approximately 50% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. the 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary u.s. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary u.s. pension plan. ​the fair values of the assets held by the u.s. pension plans by asset class are as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​fair value measurements using inputs considered as​fair value at (millions)​level 1​level 2​level 3​dec. 31, asset class    2019    2018    2019    2018    2019    2018    2019    2018 equities​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​u.s. equities​$ 1,575​$ 1,369​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ 1,575​$ 1,369​non-u.s. equities​  1,585​  1,234​  —​  —​  —​  —​  1,585​  1,234​index and long/short equity funds*​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​  417​  372​total equities​$ 3,160​$ 2,603​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ 3,577​$ 2,975​fixed income​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​u.s. government securities​$ 2,346​$ 1,889​$ 916​$ 732​$ —​$ —​$ 3,262​$ 2,621​non-u.s. government securities​  —​  —​  61​  44​  —​  —​  61​  44​preferred and convertible securities​  —​  —​  52​  44​  —​  —​  52​  44​u.s. corporate bonds​  10​  9​  3,566​  2,941​  —​  —​  3,576​  2,950​non-u.s. corporate bonds​  —​  —​  759​  475​  —​  —​  759​  475​derivative instruments​  (5)​  2​  109​  111​  —​  —​  104​  113​other*​ ​​​​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​  —​  9​total fixed income​$ 2,351​$ 1,900​$ 5,463​$ 4,347​$ —​$ —​$ 7,814​$ 6,256​private equity​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​growth equity​$ 80​$ 45​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ 80​$ 45​partnership investments*​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  1,865​  2,064​total private equity​$ 80​$ 45​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ —​$ 1,945​$ 2,109​absolute return​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​fixed income and other​$ 1​$ 28​$ 117​$ 114​$ —​$ —​$ 118​$ 142​hedge fund/fund of funds*​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  2,010​  1,866​partnership investments*​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  589​  429​total absolute return​$ 1​$ 28​$ 117​$ 114​$ —​$ —​$ 2,717​$ 2,437​cash and cash equivalents​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​cash and cash equivalents​$ 20​$ 412​$ 5​$ 4​$ —​$ —​$ 25​$ 416​repurchase agreements and derivative margin activity​​ —​​ —​​ (1)​​ (1)​​ —​​ —​​ (1)​​ (1)​cash and cash equivalents, valued at net asset value*​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  480​  870​total cash and cash equivalents​$ 20​$ 412​$ 4​$ 3​$ —​$ —​$ 504​$ 1,285​total​$ 5,612​$ 4,988​$ 5,584​$ 4,464​$ —​$ —​$ 16,557​$ 15,062​other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​$ (458)​$ (259)​fair value of plan assets​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​$ 16,099​$ 14,803​​* in accordance with asc 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (nav) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. the nav is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. the fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.​95

table of contents ​note 16. commitments and contingencies​unconditional purchase obligations:​unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-cancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). the company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of december 31, 2019, at $983 million. payments by year are estimated as follows: 2020 ($306 million), 2021 ($278 million), 2022 ($156 million), 2023 ($184 million), 2024 ($42 million) and after 2024 ($17 million). many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. the company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated. the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the company’s expected future cash outflows related to purchases.​warranties/guarantees:​3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $51 million at december 31, 2019, and $48 million at december 31, 2018. further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as the company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.​related party activity:​3m does not have any material related party activity.​legal proceedings:​the company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the united states, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. these claims, lawsuits and proceedings include, but are not limited to, products liability (involving products that the company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal false claims act, securities, and state and federal environmental laws. unless otherwise stated, the company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. from time to time, the company also receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies. the company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. these responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the company. such subpoenas and requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil or criminal legal proceedings against the company and others, as well as to settlements. the outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.​process for disclosure and recording of liabilities related to legal proceedings​many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. when making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the company complies with the requirements of asc 450, contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when liability is probable. where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. the company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.109
table of contents ​because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. many of the matters described are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. it is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. a future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. although the company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company. based on experience and developments, the company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. where appropriate, the company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. as a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the future.​process for disclosure and recording of insurance receivables related to legal proceedings​the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. for those insured legal proceedings where the company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company’s insurance program. for those insured matters where the company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.​the following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.​respirator mask/asbestos litigation​as of december 31, 2019, the company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 1,727 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,320 individual claimants with actions pending at december 31, 2018.​the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. a minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at company premises.​the company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. the company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. over the past twenty plus years, the company has prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). in 2018, 3m received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in california state court in february and the other in massachusetts state court in december – both involving allegations that 3m respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. in april 2018, a jury in state court in kentucky found 3m’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. in august 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the company appealed. during march and april 2019, the company agreed in principle to settle a substantial majority of the coal mine dust lawsuits in kentucky and west virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in april 2018 in the kentucky case mentioned above. that settlement has now been completed, and the appeal has been dismissed.​110
table of contents the company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. consequently, the company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the company’s respiratory protection products. nonetheless, the company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.​as previously reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney general, filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. the amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. the case was inactive from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in march 2011. in october 2019, the court granted the state’s motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim. in january 2020, the manufacturers filed a petition with the west virginia supreme court, challenging the trial court’s rulings. no liability has been recorded for this matter because the company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. in addition, the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the state of west virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case, and the assertions of claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.​respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and insurance receivables​the company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. the company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “claims data”). as part of its comprehensive legal review, the company regularly provides the claims data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of claims data on future filing trends and costs. the third party assists the company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. the company uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability. ​developments may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of its liabilities. these developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the company’s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.​as a result of the march and april 2019 settlements-in-principle of the coal mine dust lawsuits mentioned above, the company’s assessment of other current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits (including the costs to resolve all current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits in kentucky and west virginia), its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the company increased its accruals in 2019 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $337 million, of which $313 million pre-tax was accrued in the first quarter of 2019. in 2019, the company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $402 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. as of december 31, 2019, the company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding aearo accruals) of $608 million. this accrual represents the company’s best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the company approaching the year 2050. the company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of liabilities.​111
table of contents as of december 31, 2019, the company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4 million. the company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. once those claims for coverage are resolved, the company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.​respirator mask/asbestos litigation — aearo technologies​on april 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the company acquired the stock of aearo holding corp., the parent of aearo technologies (“aearo”). aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products.​as of december 31, 2019, aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated aearo’s respirator business (american optical corporation, warner-lambert llc, ao corp. and cabot corporation (“cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.​as of december 31, 2019, the company, through its aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $50 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. this accrual represents the company’s best estimate of aearo’s probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against aearo approaching the year 2050. the accrual was increased by $22 million from the year-end 2018, reflecting the company’s assessment of pending and expected lawsuits, its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries. responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo, cabot, american optical corporation and a subsidiary of warner lambert and their respective insurers (the “payor group”). liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “ao safety” brand and/or owned the ao safety division of american optical corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july 11, 1995. this agreement provides that, so long as aearo pays to cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to july 11, 1995. because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to january 1, 1997. with these arrangements in place, aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after january 1, 1997. to date, aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-july 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with cabot if aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.​developments may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo’s liabilities. these developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the payor group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims. if any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.​because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the payor group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo’s liabilities, the company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the company has established.​112
table of contents environmental matters and litigation​the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the united states and abroad. these laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.​under certain environmental laws, including the united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980 (cercla) and similar state laws, the company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. the company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the united states, at which it may have some liability. please refer to the section entitled “environmental liabilities and insurance receivables” that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.​environmental matters​as previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (“pfoa”), perfluorooctane sulfonate (“pfos”), perfluorohexane sulfonate (“pfhxs”), or other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively “pfas”). as a result of its phase-out decision in may 2000, the company no longer manufactures certain pfas compounds including pfoa, pfos, pfhxs, and their pre-cursor compounds. the company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. the company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length pfas compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane sulfonate (“pfbs”). these compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the company’s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain pfas in purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3m’s current fluorochemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.​regulatory activities concerning pfas continue in the united states, europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. these activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. as the database of studies of both pfoa and pfos has expanded, the epa has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. in february 2014, the epa initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for pfoa and pfos. the peer review panel met in august 2014. in may 2016, the epa announced lifetime health advisory levels for pfoa and pfos at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established by the epa in 2009 of 400 ppt for pfoa and 200 ppt for pfos). where pfoa and pfos are found together, epa recommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for pfoa and pfos combined is also 70 ppt. lifetime health advisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. to collect exposure information under the safe drinking water act, the epa published on may 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six pfas chemicals, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. through january 2017, the epa reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide. based on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for pfoa and 46 exceed the level for pfos (unchanged from the july 2016 epa summary). a technical advisory issued by epa in september 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public water supplies had exceeded the combined level for pfoa and pfos. these results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. epa reporting does not identify the sources of the pfoa and pfos in the public water supplies.​113
table of contents the company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate its historic disposal of pfas-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at its decatur, alabama; cottage grove, minnesota; and cordova, illinois plants. as previously reported, the company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the alabama department of environmental management (adem) to remediate the presence of pfas in the soil at the company’s manufacturing facility in decatur, alabama. for approximately 20 years (1978-1998), pursuant to a permit issued by adem, the company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge, which contained pfas, in fields at its decatur facility. after a review of the available options to address the presence of pfas in the soil, adem agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. implementation of that plan continues.​the company continues to work with the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed may 2007 settlement agreement and consent order to address the presence of certain pfas in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury) and at the company’s manufacturing facility at cottage grove, minnesota. under this agreement, the company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain pfas from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a health based value (“hbv”) or health risk limit (“hrl”) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the minnesota department of health (mdh) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain pfas for which a hbv and/or hrl exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other pfas at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate pfoa and pfos; and (iv) sharing information with the mpca about certain perfluorinated compounds. during 2008, the mpca issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury). in august 2009, the mpca issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the company’s cottage grove manufacturing facility. during the spring and summer of 2010, 3m began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the cottage grove and woodbury sites. 3m commenced the remedial option at the oakdale site in late 2010. at each location the remedial options were recommended by the company and approved by the mpca. remediation work has been completed at the oakdale and woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. remediation continued at the cottage grove site during 2019.​in august 2014, the illinois epa approved a request by the company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in cordova, illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.​in may 2017, the mdh issued new hbvs for pfos and pfoa. the new hbvs are 35 ppt for pfoa and 27 ppt for pfos. in connection with its announcement the mdh stated that “drinking water with pfoa and pfos, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate health risk. these values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” in december 2017, the mdh issued a new hbv for perfluorobutane sulfonate (pfbs) of 2 parts per billion (ppb). in february 2018, the mdh published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or adverse birth outcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of washington and dakota counties in minnesota. in april 2019, the mdh issued a new hbv for pfos of 15 ppt and a new hbv for pfhxs of 47 ppt.​in may 2018, the epa announced a four-step pfas action plan, which includes evaluating the need to set safe drinking water act maximum contaminant levels (mcls) for pfoa and pfos and beginning the steps necessary to designate pfoa and pfos as “hazardous substances” under cercla. in november 2018, the epa asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for two pfas compounds, including pfbs. in february 2019, the epa issued a pfas action plan that outlines short- and long-term actions the epa is taking to address pfas – actions that include developing a national drinking water determination for pfoa and pfos, strengthening enforcement authorities and evaluating cleanup approaches, nationwide drinking water monitoring for pfas, expanding scientific knowledge for understanding and managing risk from pfas, and developing consistent risk communication tools for communicating with other agencies and the public. with respect to groundwater contaminated with pfoa and pfos, the epa issued interim recommendations in december 2019, providing guidance for screening levels and preliminary remediation goals for groundwater that is a current or potential drinking water source, to inform final clean-up levels of contaminated sites.​the u.s. agency for toxic substances and disease registry (atsdr) within the department of health and human services released a draft toxicological profile for pfas for public review and comment in june 2018. in the draft report, atsdr proposed draft minimal risk levels (mrls) for pfos, pfoa and several other pfas. an mrl is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a 114
table of contents hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. mrls are not intended to define cleanup or action levels for atsdr or other agencies. in august 2018, 3m submitted comments on the atsdr proposal, noting that there are major shortcomings with the current draft, especially with the mrls, and that the atsdr’s profile must reflect the best science and full weight of evidence known about these chemicals.​several state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards, groundwater values or drinking water values for pfos, pfoa, and other pfas, and 3m has submitted various responsive comments. in september 2019, 3m and several other parties filed a lawsuit in new hampshire state court to enjoin new pfas regulations in new hampshire. in november 2019, the court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the regulations from being enforced. new hampshire has made a motion to appeal that decision with the state supreme court.​the company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing or other proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.​litigation related to historical pfas manufacturing operations in alabama​as previously reported, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit against 3m, bfi waste management systems of alabama, and others in the circuit court of morgan county, alabama (the “st. john” case), seeking property damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the company’s decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility. the st. john case was stayed through january 2020, pending ongoing mediation between the parties involved in this case and another case discussed below. the parties have submitted a joint motion to extend the stay through april 2020. two additional putative class actions filed in the same court by certain residents in the vicinity of the decatur plant seeking relief on similar grounds (the chandler case and the stover case, respectively) are stayed pending the resolution of class certification issues in the st. john case. ​in october 2015, west morgan-east lawrence water & sewer authority (water authority) filed an individual complaint against 3m company, dyneon, l.l.c, and daikin america, inc., in the u.s. district court for the northern district of alabama. the complaint also includes representative plaintiffs who brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property who use water provided by the water authority and five local water works to which the water authority supplies water (collectively, the “water utilities”). the complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’ chemicals, including pfoa and pfos from their manufacturing processes in decatur, have contaminated the water in the tennessee river at the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment processes utilized by the water authority. in april 2019, 3m and the water authority settled the lawsuit for $35 million, which will fund a new water filtration system, with 3m indemnifying the water authority from liability resulting from the resolution of the currently pending and future lawsuits against the water authority alleging liability or damages related to 3m pfas. the putative class claims brought by the representative plaintiffs remain, and a motion for class certification is currently pending. ​in june 2016, the tennessee riverkeeper, inc. (riverkeeper), a non-profit corporation, filed a lawsuit in the u.s. district court for the northern district of alabama against 3m; bfi waste systems of alabama; the city of decatur, alabama; and the municipal utilities board of decatur, morgan county, alabama. the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the resource conservation and recovery act in connection with the disposal of certain pfas through their ownership and operation of their respective sites. the complaint further alleges such practices may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health and/or the environment and that riverkeeper has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm caused by defendants’ failure to abate the endangerment unless the court grants the requested relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. this case has been stayed through april 2020, pending ongoing mediation between the parties in conjunction with the st. john case. ​in august 2016, a group of over 200 plaintiffs filed a putative class action against west morgan-east lawrence water and sewer authority (water authority), 3m, dyneon, daikin, bfi, and the city of decatur in state court in lawrence county, alabama (the “billings” case). plaintiffs are residents of lawrence, morgan and other counties who are or have been customers of the water authority. they contend defendants have released pfas that contaminate the tennessee river and, in turn, their drinking water, causing damage to their health and properties. in january 2017, the court in the st. john case, discussed above, stayed this litigation pending resolution of the st. john case.​in january 2017, several hundred plaintiffs sued 3m, its subsidiary dyneon, and daikin america in lawrence and morgan counties, alabama (the “owens” case). the plaintiffs are owners of property, residents, and holders of property interests who receive their 115
table of contents water from the west morgan-east lawrence water and sewer authority (water authority). they assert common law claims for negligence, nuisance, trespass, wantonness, and battery, and they seek injunctive relief and punitive damages. the plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in decatur that have released and continue to release pfoa, pfos and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharges into the tennessee river. the plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water supplied by the water authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with pfoa, pfos, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. the court denied a motion by co-defendant daikin to stay this case pending resolution of the st. john case, and the case is progressing through discovery.​in november 2017, a putative class action (the “king” case) was filed against 3m, its subsidiary dyneon, daikin america, and the west morgan-east lawrence water and sewer authority (water authority) in the u.s. district court for the northern district of alabama. the plaintiffs are residents of lawrence and morgan county, alabama who receive their water from the water authority and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged personal injuries. the plaintiffs contend that the defendants own and operate manufacturing and disposal facilities in decatur that have released and continue to release pfoa, pfos and related chemicals into the groundwater and surface water of their sites, resulting in discharges into the tennessee river. the plaintiffs contend that, as a result of the alleged discharges, the water supplied by the water authority to the plaintiffs was, and is, contaminated with pfoa, pfos, and related chemicals at a level dangerous to humans. in november 2019, the king plaintiffs amended their complaint to withdraw all class allegations, dismiss the water authority as a defendant, and add 24 new individual plaintiffs (for a total of 59 plaintiffs).​in march 2018, an individual plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the u.s. district court for the northern district of alabama raising allegations and claims substantially similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in the king case. this case was dismissed without prejudice when the plaintiffs joined a previously pending case.​in january 2018, certain property owners in trinity, alabama filed a lawsuit against 3m, dyneon, and three unnamed defendants in the u.s. district court for the northern district of alabama. the plaintiffs assert claims for negligence, strict liability, trespass, nuisance, wanton and reckless conduct, and citizen suit claims for violation of the resource conservation and recovery act. they allege these claims arise from the defendants’ contamination of their property by disposal of pfas in a landfill located on their property. the plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages and a court order directing the defendants to remediate all pfas contamination on their property. in september 2018, the case was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.​in july 2019, 3m announced that it had initiated an investigation into the possible presence of pfas in three closed municipal landfills in decatur that accepted waste from 3m’s decatur plant and other companies in the 1960s through the 1980s. 3m is working with local and state entities as it conducts its investigation and will report the results and

securities exchange act of 1934 and sec rule 10b-5 against all defendants, and under section 20(a) of the securities and exchange act of 1934 against the individual defendants. in october 2019, the court consolidated the securities class actions and appointed a group of lead plaintiffs. the suit is in the early stages of litigation.​in october 2019, a follow-on derivative lawsuit was filed in the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey against 3m and several of its current and former executives and directors. in november and december 2019, two additional derivative lawsuits were filed in a minnesota state court. the derivative lawsuits rely on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. plaintiffs have agreed to stay these cases pending a ruling on a motion to dismiss the securities class action.​other environmental litigation​in july 2018, the company, along with more than 120 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the cleaning up of approximately eight miles of the lower passaic river in new jersey. the plaintiff, occidental chemical corporation, alleges that it agreed to design and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including pcbs and dioxins. the complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the company. the company’s involvement in the case relates to its past use of two commercial drum conditioning facilities in new jersey. whether, and to what extent, the company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined.​for environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise stated, no liability has been recorded as the company believes liability in those matters is not probable and estimable and the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time. the company’s environmental liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.​environmental liabilities and insurance receivables​the company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and estimable based on experience and developments in those matters. during the first quarter of 2019, the epa issued its pfas action plan and the company settled the litigation with the water authority (both matters are described in more detail above). the company completed a comprehensive review with the assistance of environmental consultants and other experts regarding environmental matters and litigation related to historical pfas manufacturing operations in minnesota, alabama, gendorf germany, and at four former landfills in alabama. as a result of these developments and of that review, the company increased its accrual for “other environmental liabilities” by $235 million pre-tax (including the settlement with the water authority) in the first quarter of 2019. during the fourth quarter of 2019, 3m updated its evaluation of certain customer-related litigation based on continued, productive settlement discussions with multiple parties. as previously disclosed, 3m has been engaged in mediation and resolution negotiations in multiple cases. in addition, during the fourth quarter, the company updated its assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to its historical pfas manufacturing operations and expanded its evaluation of other 3m sites that may have used certain pfas-containing materials and locations at which they were disposed. as a result of these actions during the fourth quarter the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $214 million. as of december 31, 2019, the company had recorded liabilities of $445 million for “other environmental liabilities.” the accruals represent the company’s best estimate of the probable loss. the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.​as of december 31, 2019, the company had recorded liabilities of $19 million for estimated non-pfas related “environmental remediation” costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3m manufacturing or third-party sites. the company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action. liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial 121
table of contents viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.​it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. developments may occur that could affect the company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. for sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. however, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.​the company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. as of december 31, 2019, the company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the environmental matters and litigation was $33 million. the company increased its receivable for insurance recoveries by $25 million in the first quarter of 2019. various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.​product liability litigation​as of december 31, 2019, the company was a named defendant in nine lawsuits in the united states involving 12 plaintiffs (compared to approximately 5,015 plaintiffs at december 31, 2018) and one canadian punitive class action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that the bair hugger™ patient warming system caused a surgical site infection. ​as previously disclosed, 3m had been a named defendant in lawsuits in federal courts involving over 5,000 plaintiffs. the plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the bair hugger™ patient warming system. the plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts.​the u.s. judicial panel on multidistrict litigation (jpml) consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation (mdl) proceeding. in july 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs’ causation experts, and granted summary judgment for 3m in all cases pending at that time in the mdl. plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit. plaintiffs have also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3m in the first bellwether trial in the mdl and appealed the dismissal of another bellwether case. ​among the nine remaining lawsuits in the united states, eight are in the mdl court. of the eight cases in the mdl, four cases were removed from a missouri state court. three of those four were dismissed with the july 2019 mdl summary judgment decision referenced above. plaintiffs, however, have filed motions to remand all four missouri cases to state court. all eight remaining lawsuits in the mdl court have been stayed pending the appeal of the summary judgment decision. the ninth case is one the company has been defending in hidalgo county, texas, which combines bair hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. in august 2019, the u.s. district court managing the mdl enjoined the individual plaintiff from pursuing his claims in texas state court because he had previously filed and dismissed a claim in the mdl. that plaintiff has appealed the order to the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit. the texas state court has stayed the entire case while the appeal is pending. ​122
table of contents as previously disclosed, 3m had been named a defendant in 61 cases in minnesota state court. in january 2018, the minnesota state court excluded plaintiffs’ experts and granted 3m’s motion for summary judgment on general causation. plaintiffs appealed that ruling and the state court’s punitive damages ruling. the minnesota court of appeals affirmed the minnesota state court orders in their entirety and the minnesota supreme court denied plaintiffs’ petition for review. final dismissal was entered in april 2019, effectively ending the minnesota state court cases. in june 2016, the company was served with a putative class action filed in the ontario superior court of justice for all canadian residents who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the bair hugger™ patient warming system. the representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the mdl. ​no liability has been recorded for the bair hugger™ litigation because the company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.​in september 2011, 3m oral care launched lava ultimate cad/cam dental restorative material. the product was originally indicated for inlay, onlay, veneer, and crown applications. in june 2015, 3m oral care voluntarily removed crown applications from the product’s instructions for use, following reports from dentists of patients’ crowns debonding, requiring additional treatment. the product remains on the market for other applications. 3m communicated with the u.s. food and drug administration, as well as regulators outside the united states. 3m also informed customers and distributors of its action, offered to accept return of unused materials and provide refunds. in may 2018, 3m reached a preliminary settlement for an amount that did not have a material impact to the company of the lawsuit pending in the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota that sought certification of a class of dentists in the united states and its territories. in september 2019, the court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement.​aearo technologies sold dual-ended combat arms – version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3m acquired aearo technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. in december 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3m in the san bernardino superior court in california alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3m’s dual-ended combat arms earplugs – version 2. the plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. the plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. as of december 31, 2019, the company is a named defendant in approximately 2,531 lawsuits (including 14 putative class actions) in various state and federal courts that purport to represent approximately 11,318 individual claimants making similar allegations. in april 2019, the u.s. judicial panel on multidistrict litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the u.s. district court for the northern district of florida to be managed in a multi-district litigation (mdl) proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. the court conducted a case management conference in june 2019 on a discovery plan and scheduling. discovery is underway. no liability has been recorded for these matters because the company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.​for product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. in addition, the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.​federal false claims act / qui tam litigation​in october 2019, 3m acquired acelity, inc. and its kci subsidiaries, including kinetic concepts, inc. and kci usa, inc. as previously disclosed in the sec filings by kci entities, in 2009, kinetic concepts, inc. received a subpoena from the u.s. department of health and human services office of inspector general. in 2011, following the completion of the government’s review and its decision declining to intervene in two qui tam actions described further below, the qui tam relator-plaintiffs’ pleadings were unsealed. ​the government inquiry followed two qui tam actions filed in 2008 by two former employees against kinetic concepts, inc. and kci usa, inc. (collectively, the “kci defendants”) under seal in the u.s. district court for the central district of california. the complaints contain allegations that the kci defendants violated the federal false claims act by submitting false or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for v.a.c.® therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the local coverage determinations issued by the durable medical equipment medicare administrative contractors and seek monetary damages. one complaint (the “godecke case”) also contains allegations that the kci defendants retaliated against the relator-plaintiff for alleged whistle-blowing behavior.123
table of contents ​in october 2016, the kci defendants filed counterclaims in the godecke case, asserting breach of contract and conversion. in august 2017, the fraud claim of the godecke case was dismissed. in january 2018, the district court stayed the retaliation claim and the kci defendants' counterclaims pending the relator-plaintiff’s appeal. in september 2019, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. during a january 2020 status conference, the district court ordered a stay of the proceedings until april 2020. in june 2019, following discovery, the district court in the second case (the “hartpence case”) entered summary judgment in the kci defendants’ favor on all of the relator-plaintiff’s claims. the plaintiff then filed an appeal in the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit, which is pending. no liability has been recorded for these matters because the company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.​compliance matter​the company, through its internal processes, discovered certain travel activities and related funding and record keeping issues raising concerns, arising from marketing efforts by certain business groups based in china. the company initiated an internal investigation to determine whether the expenditures may have violated the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or other potentially applicable anti-corruption laws. the company has retained outside counsel and a forensic accounting firm to assist with the investigation. in july 2019, the company voluntarily disclosed this investigation to both the department of justice and securities and exchange commission and is cooperating with both agencies. the company cannot predict at this time the outcome of its investigation or what potential actions may be taken by the department of justice or securities and exchange commission.​note 17. leases​the company adopted asu no. 2016-02 and related standards (collectively asc 842, leases), which replaced previous lease accounting guidance, on january 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. 3m elected the transition method expedient which allows entities to initially apply the requirements by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. as a result of electing this transition method, prior periods have not been restated. due to the cumulative net impact of adopting asc 842, the january 1, 2019 balance of retained earnings was increased by $14 million, primarily relating to previously deferred gains from sale-leaseback transactions. in addition, adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right of use assets and associated lease liabilities of $0.8 billion each as of january 1, 2019. the company’s accounting for finance leases (previously called capital leases) remains substantially unchanged. asc 842 did not have a material impact on 3m’s consolidated income statement. 3m elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within asc 842, which includes not reassessing lease classification of existing leases. the company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient.​the components of lease expense are as follows:​​​​​​​    year ended(millions)​december 31, 2019operating lease cost​$ 308​finance lease cost:​​​​amortization of assets​​ 20​interest on lease liabilities​​ 2​variable lease cost​​ 93​total net lease cost​$ 423​​​124
