table of contentsdistribution​3m products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous e-commerce and traditional wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3m and its products — a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3m’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.​resources​human capital​on december 31, 2020, the company employed approximately 95,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 40,000 employed in the united states and 55,000 employed internationally. the ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3m’s success. this includes four general categories of focus: health and safety; development; diversity, equity and inclusion; and compensation and benefits.​health and safety​3m is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. the company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3m policy; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3m sites. 3m also promotes a culture of health and well-being through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits. ​development​developing employees contributes to growing 3m’s business. 3m maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the company’s chief executive officer (ceo) and reporting up through the board of directors. the company has a suite of high-potential leadership development programs which brings a consistent approach to leadership development. 3m also has development programs for managers and supervisors and provides learning opportunities for all employees. with the company’s global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique, just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills. ​diversity, equity and inclusion ​a diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3m remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. 3m focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to continue advancing pay equity and to increase the company’s diversity with underrepresented groups. 3m supports these values with an internal ceo inclusion council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. the company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which its employees live and 3m business operates. ​compensation and benefits​in addition to a professional work environment that promotes innovation and rewards performance, 3m’s total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. in addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the company’s goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3m is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. eligible full-time employees in the united states also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3m employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. some of these benefits can also be available to regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, 6
table of contentssuch as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.​raw materials ​in 2020, the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. generally, as demand for certain covid-related products surged, 3m saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. within the supply chain of less essential products, 3m experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. conversely, as markets re-opened and demand increased, the company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.​the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. overall, on a consolidated basis, 3m experienced net raw material price deflation in 2020. to date, the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. in addition, 3m evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.​patents, trademarks and licenses ​the company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. the company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. the actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. ​the company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. in general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company’s business segments.​government regulation and environmental law compliance​the company’s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the u.s. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws, u.s. trade sanctions, regulations of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and similar foreign agencies, u.s. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations, such as the false claims act, anti-kickback laws and the sunshine act.​3m’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. the company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3m has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “environmental matters and litigation” in note 16, commitments and contingencies).​environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.​in 2020, 3m expended approximately $55 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality 7

table of contentsthe company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states, and, accordingly, the company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates. climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate.* the company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with the coronavirus (covid-19). 3m, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with covid-19. the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. in addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3m’s operations. in these challenging and dynamic circumstances, 3m continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. covid-19 has impacted 3m’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. even with 3m’s accelerated production at its global facilities combined with capacity from other manufacturers, the industry-wide challenge is that global demand for n95 and other respirators continues to exceed the industries’ ability to deliver. within individual regions and countries around the world, 3m is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. 3m’s manufacturing, supply chain and distribution protocols have, for example, been impacted by the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the federal emergency management agency pursuant to the u.s. defense production act. in addition, trade barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3m going into the most needed areas. covid-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3m. some of these covid-related factors have increased demand for certain 3m products, while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3m to serve customers. 3m has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its n95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3m against those who seek to exploit 3m’s brand and reputation and defraud others. furthermore, covid-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. for example, covid-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. as economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. as part of the return to work process at the company, the company could face additional privacy and data security risks related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to covid-19 testing, temperature checks, and contact tracing. due to the speed and scope with which the covid situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3m is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.* foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. because the company’s financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company’s revenues are derived from outside the united states, the company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings* the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.11
table of contentsas previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company, collectively known as “pfas.” the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. these characteristics have made pfas critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. they are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology. pfas compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3m, and are used in everyday products. as science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (pfoa) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) globally as a precautionary measure. we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the u.s. completed by the end of 2002. phased out products included aqueous film forming foam (afff) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfas-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in note 16, “commitments and contingencies,” within the notes to consolidated financial statements. an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. for example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise.* the company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws, u.s. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and similar foreign agencies, u.s. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the false claims act, anti-kickback laws, the sunshine act, or other matters. legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the company’s suppliers, vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3m’s supplier responsibility code, 3m performance requirements or with legal requirements.the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. although the company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. in addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the company may negatively impact the company’s reputation. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in note 16, “commitments and contingencies,” within the notes to consolidated financial statements.risks related to our products and customer preferences* the company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. demand for the company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company’s products; and (v) changes in the 12
table of contentsbusiness environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data. * the company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. this ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.* the company’s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, natural disasters and other disruptive factors. the company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters and other disruptive events, or be terminated. any sustained interruption in the company’s receipt of adequate supplies or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.risks related to our business* the company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the company to liability which could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation. in the ordinary course of business, the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. additionally, the company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and third-party service providers, security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nation-state actors, computer viruses, hardware, software, and system vulnerabilities, ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. the company’s increased adoption of remote working, which was driven by the pandemic, may also introduce additional threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure. despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the company. any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, interference with the company’s operations, and damage to the company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the company’s business. although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.​* acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the recently completed acquisition of acelity, inc. and its kci subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. the company 13
table of contentsrealigned from five to four business segments, effective in april of 2019, to better serve its global customers and markets. successful execution of the realignment and the associated adjustments of our portfolio and business operating model, as well as other organizational changes, will be important to the company’s future results.* the company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. the company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. this is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an erp system. there can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. in addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important, which, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the company’s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3m’s brand. operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial conditions and results of operations.risks related to financial and capital markets and tax matters* the company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results. the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.* change in the company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. the company’s credit ratings are important to 3m’s cost of capital. the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m. this evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service and an a+ credit rating with a negative outlook from standard & poor’s. the company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3m’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. the addition of further leverage to the company’s capital structure could impact 3m’s credit ratings in the future. failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.​* changes in tax rates, laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results. the company’s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. in addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from u.s. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the company’s consolidated statement of earnings. in connection with the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) integrated framework provided by organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related factors stated above, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.item 1b. unresolved staff comments.​none.​14

table of contentsimplemented plant and/or line shutdowns during 2020 related to certain markets due to weaker customer demand or government mandates. some of the above factors have increased the demand for 3m products, while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for 3m to serve customers. serving 3m customers is a priority and teams continue to communicate with individual customers about potential disruptions. ​3m’s total sales increased 0.1% for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019. organic local-currency sales decreased 1.7% for the full year 2020 when compared to 2019. given the diversity of 3m’s businesses, the impact of covid-19 varied across the company throughout 2020. 3m experienced strong sales growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas such as home improvement, general cleaning, semiconductor, data center, and biopharma filtration. covid-related respirator sales are estimated to have impacted year-on-year organic local-currency sales growth by approximately 3 percent for the year ending december 31, 2020. at the same time, weakness in several end markets, while improving, contributed in part to sales declines in a number of 3m’s businesses with the biggest year-on-year total sales decreases in oral care (down 19 percent), advanced materials (down 17 percent), automotive and aerospace (down 16 percent), commercial solutions (down 14 percent), stationery and office (down 11 percent), closure and masking (down 11 percent), automotive aftermarket (down 10 percent), and businesses aligned to general industrial applications such as abrasives (down 15 percent) and industrial adhesives and tapes (down 5 percent).​3m’s operating income margins increased 3.1 percentage points year-on-year for the year ending december 31, 2020. factoring out the impact on operating income of special items as described in the certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures) section below, operating income margins increased 0.1 points to 21.3 percent for the year ending december 31, 2020 when compared to 2019. various covid-19 implications contributed in part to these results.​overall, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on 3m’s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains as described above. while it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3m’s results of operations, below are factors that 3m believes have also affected its 2020 results:​factors contributing to charges:●period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables.●restructuring actions addressing structural enterprise costs and operations in certain end markets as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and related economic impact resulting in a second quarter 2020 charge of $58 million (as further discussed in note 5).●committed financial support to various covid-relief and medical research initiatives.●charge of $22 million related to equity securities as discussed in the “assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis” section of note 15 that use the measurement alternative described therein in addition to an immaterial pre-tax charge related to impairment of certain indefinite lived tradenames in the first quarter of 2020. 3m continues to regularly consider if covid-19 and other related market implications could indicate it is more likely than not the carrying amount of various applicable assets may be impaired and assess whether certain investments without readily determinable fair values may have been impacted. ​factors providing benefits or other impacts:●decreased discretionary spending in areas such as travel, professional services, and advertising/merchandising as well as cost reduction efforts, hiring freezes, and maintaining only essential contract workers. 3m continues to monitor discretionary spending and deploy cost control efforts as the situation continues.●government-sponsored covid-response stimulus and relief initiatives, including certain employment retention benefits under the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security (cares) act in the united states.●lower self-insured medical visit/instance expense during 2020.●instituted accelerated vacation usage policies which benefited the second quarter of 2020 year-on-year, but provided a penalty in comparison to prior year in the second half of 2020.​as previously disclosed, in light of circumstances, 3m took actions to ensure sources of cash may remain strong, including the march 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion of registered notes, suspension of share repurchases, and the decrease of its 2020 capital spending to approximately $1.5 billion. while capital spending decreased, it included additional expansion of respirator production capacity. 3m

table of contentscertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures): ​in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap, the company also provides non-gaap measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. for the periods presented, special items include the items described below. beginning in 2020, the company includes gain/loss on sale of businesses and divestiture-related restructuring actions as special items due to their potential distortion of underlying operating results. information provided herein reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented. operating income (measure of segment operating performance), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3m provides the reported gaap measure and a measure adjusted for special items. the adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, gaap measures. the company considers these non-gaap measures in evaluating and managing the company’s operations. the company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of

company’s gas and flame detection business, 3m recorded an after-tax gain of $43 million. in the third quarter of 2019, 3m recorded a gain related to the divestiture of the company’s gas and flame detection business and an immaterial impact as a result of measuring a disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, which in aggregate resulted in a pre-tax gain of $106 million ($79 million after tax).●in the first quarter of 2018, 3m recorded a gain related to the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring, the sale of its polymer additives compounding business, and a gain on final closing adjustments from a prior divestiture which, in aggregate, resulted in a net pre-tax gain

table of contentsdesigned to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3m’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.​financial condition: ​3m generated $8.1 billion of operating cash flow in 2020, an increase of $1.0 billion when compared to 2019. this increase was primarily due to cost saving actions taken in response to covid-19 and lower year-on-year significant litigation-related charges and the timing of associated payments. this followed an operating cash flow increase of $631 million when comparing 2019 to 2018. refer to the section entitled “financial condition and liquidity” later in md&a for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. ​in november 2018, 3m’s board of directors replaced the company’s february 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. this new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3m’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. in 2020, the company purchased $0.4 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $1.4 billion in 2019. as of december 31, 2020, approximately $7.8 billion remained available under the authorization. in the first quarter of 2020, the company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program with other repurchase activity limited to 3m’s stock compensation plans. the company plans to resume share purchases in 2021. in february 2021, 3m’s board of directors declared a first-quarter 2021 dividend of $1.48 per share, an increase of 1 percent. this marked the 63rd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m. ​raw materials:​in 2020, the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. generally, as demand for certain covid-related products surged, 3m saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. within the supply chain of less essential products, 3m experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. conversely, as markets re-opened and demand increased, the company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.​in response, the company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. overall, on a consolidated basis, 3m experienced net raw material deflation in 2020. to date, the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. in addition, 3m evaluates suppliers’ conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.​pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:​on a worldwide basis, 3m’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2020. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans were 93 percent funded. the u.s. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. asset returns in 2020 for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan were 13.6%, as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 6.50%. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan year-end 2020 discount rate was 2.55%, down 0.70 percentage points from the year-end 2019 discount rate of 3.25%. the decrease in u.s. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (pbo). the primary u.s. qualified pension plan’s funded status decreased 1 percentage point in 2020 due to the higher pbo resulting from the discount rate decrease and partially offset by higher return on assets. additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in note 13 (pension and postretirement benefit plans).​3m expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2021. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2021. 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2021 to decrease by approximately $40 million pre-tax when 28

table of contentsportfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.​using this methodology, the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:​​​​​​​​​​u.s. qualified pension    international pension (weighted average)    u.s. postretirement medical​december 31, 2020 liability:​​​​​​​benefit obligation​ 2.55% 1.38% 2.35%2021 net periodic benefit cost components:​​​​​​​service cost​ 2.84% 1.23% 2.71%interest cost​ 1.93% 1.13% 1.68%​another significant element in determining the company’s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. the expected return on plan assets for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2021 is 6.50%, a decrease from 6.75% in 2020. return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. the weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 4.36% for 2021 compared to 4.70% for 2020. refer to note 13 for information on how the 2020 rates were determined.​3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures in determining the fair value of plan assets within the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. see note 13 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.​for the year ended december 31, 2020, the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $456 million and a benefit of $50 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $406 million, up from $357 million in 2019. ​in 2021, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $497 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $130 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $367 million, a decrease of approximately $40 million compared to 2020.​the table below summarizes the impact on 2021 pension expense for the u.s. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2020 net periodic benefit cost. the table assumes all other factors are held constant, including the slope of the discount rate yield curves.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost​​​discount rate​expected return on assets (millions)   -0.25%   +0.25%   -0.25%   +0.25% u.s. pension plans​$ 34​$ (34)​$ 39​$ (39)​international pension plans​  27​  (28)​  21​  (17)​​41
table of contentsgoodwill and certain long-lived assets:​the company makes certain estimates and judgments in relation to goodwill and certain long-lived assets. those include considerations made in the valuation of certain acquired identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets as a result of business combinations as well as considerations in the recoverability and impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill.​acquisition of certain identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived assets​in conjunction with an acquisition of a business, the company records identifiable definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. the corresponding fair value estimates for these assets acquired include projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, asset life cycles, royalty rates, and customer retention rates. the fair value calculated for indefinite-lived intangible assets such as certain tradenames, in addition to intangible assets that are definite-lived such as patents, customer relationships, tradenames and other technology-based assets may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation, due to the significant estimates used in determining their fair value. as a result, the company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded for certain items as part of the purchase price allocation subsequent to the acquisition, not to exceed one year after the acquisition date, until the purchase accounting allocation is finalized.​assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill​as of december 31, 2020, net property, plant and equipment totaled $9.4 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $5.8 billion, of which $0.7 billion related to indefinite-lived tradenames. in addition, 3m goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of december 31, 2020. long-lived assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. if an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, as further discussed below, and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. if future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3m would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. for instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. these risk factors are discussed in item 1a, “risk factors,” of this document. in addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results.​as of december 31, 2020, the $0.7 billion of indefinite-lived tradenames primarily relates to capital safety (acquired in 2015), whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 60 years (refer to note 4 for more detail). the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. in the first quarter of 2020, 3m reflected an immaterial charge related to impairment of certain indefinite-lived assets in 2020. based on annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2020, no additional impairment was indicated. ​3m goodwill totaled approximately $13.8 billion as of december 31, 2020. 3m’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units 42
table of contentswithin the same segment have similar economic characteristics. at 3m, reporting units correspond to a division. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3m typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions. where applicable, 3m uses a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. the weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.​as described in note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the company changed its business segment reporting. for any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. in conjunction with the change in segment reporting, 3m completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment existed as a result of this new segment structure. the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2020 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.​based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2020, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. as of october 1, 2020, 3m had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 93 percent of the goodwill. these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: advanced materials, display materials and systems, electronics materials solutions, health information systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, medical solutions, oral care solutions, personal safety, separation and purification sciences, and transportation safety.​3m is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3m’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3m’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. ​3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2021 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.​uncertainty in income tax positions:​the extent of 3m’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. the company follows guidance provided by asc 740, income taxes, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to note 10 for additional information). the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. if the company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.​new accounting pronouncements​information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.​43
table of contentsfinancial condition and liquidity​the strength and stability of 3m’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the company to invest through business cycles. investing in 3m’s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. this includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. organic investments will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. the company also continues to actively manage its portfolio to maximize value for shareholders. given uncertainty arising from covid-19, the company suspended repurchases under its board-approved share repurchase program effective march 2020 with other repurchase activity limited to 3m’s stock compensation plans. 3m will continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and plans to resume share repurchases in 2021. 3m maintains strong liquidity and further added to its liquidity position through the issuance of $1.75 billion in registered notes in march 2020. to fund cash needs in the united states, the company relies on ongoing cash flow from u.s. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. for those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for u.s. operations. see note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.​3m’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and u.s. commercial paper issuances. 3m believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3m’s commercial paper program permits the company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. at december 31, 2020, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.​total debt:​the strength of 3m’s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3m proven access to capital markets. additionally, the company’s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3m currently has an a1 credit rating with a negative outlook from moody’s investors service and an a+ credit rating with negative outlook from standard and poor’s.​the company’s total debt was $1.5 billion lower at december 31, 2020 when compared to december 31, 2019. decreases in debt are further described in note 12 and include the repayment of aggregate $445 million principal amount of third lien notes subject to in-substance defeasance, 650 million euros and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured, the december 2020 repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes related to make-whole-call offers, lower commercial paper balance, and the repayment of the 80 billion japanese yen and 150 million euro credit facilities. these decreases were partially offset by the march 2020 issuance of $1.75 billion of registered notes. for discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “cash flows from

debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments and continues to evaluate commercial contracts that may utilize libor as the reference rate. 3m will continue its assessment and monitor regulatory developments during the transition period.​effective february 10, 2020, the company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (wksi) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. this replaced 3m’s previous shelf registration dated february 24, 2017. in may 2016, in connection with the wksi shelf, 3m entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the company’s medium-term notes program (series f), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same series.​as of december 31, 2020, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (series f), inclusive of debt issued in february 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). additionally, the august 2019 and march 2020 debt was issued under the wksi shelf registration, but not as part of the medium-term notes program (series f). information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in note 12.44
table of contentsthe company has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in november 2024. the revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender’s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. in addition, 3m entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which was renewed in november 2020 with an expiration date of november 2021. the 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans with a maturity date one year later. these credit facilities were undrawn at december 31, 2020. under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. at december 31, 2020, this ratio was approximately 17 to 1. debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.​apart from the committed credit facilities described above, in september 2019, 3m entered into a credit facility initially expiring in july 2020 that was further extended to august 2021 in the amount of 80 billion japanese yen. in november 2019, 3m entered into a credit facility expiring in november 2020 in the amount of 150 million euros. during the third quarter of 2020, the company paid the outstanding balances and closed these credit facilities. the company also had $273 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at december 31, 2020. these instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.​cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:​at december 31, 2020, 3m had $5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.8 billion was held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $2.3 billion was held by the united states. these balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. at december 31, 2019, 3m had $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.4 billion was held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $100 million was held by the united states. the increase from december 31, 2019 primarily resulted from strong cash flow from operations, reduced capital expenditures, and lower share repurchases. ​net debt (non-gaap measure):​net debt is not defined under u.s. gaap and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. the company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3m believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3m considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. the following table provides net debt as of december 31, 2020 and 2019.​​​​​​​​​​​​​    december 31,  ​2020 versus​(millions)​2020​2019 2019​total debt​$ 18,795​$ 20,313​$ (1,518)​less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities​  5,068​  2,494​  2,574​net debt (non-gaap measure)​$ 13,727​$ 17,819​$ (4,092)​​refer to the preceding “total debt” and “cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities” sections for additional details. ​balance sheet:​3m’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.​the company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.​45

table of contentsin 2020, roic of 18.2 percent was higher than 2019. the increase was driven by the lower year-over-year impact of significant litigation-related charges in addition to the non-repeating charge from the 2019 deconsolidation of the company’s venezuela subsidiary. 2019 roic was also negatively impacted by the increase in cash and cash equivalents in anticipation of the funding of the acquisition of acelity. ​​​​​​​​​years ended december 31        ​        ​    (millions)​2020​2019​​​​​​​​​return on invested capital (non-gaap measure)​​​​​​​net income including non-controlling interest​$ 5,388​$ 4,582​interest expense (after-tax) (1)​​ 425​​ 359​adjusted net income (return)​$ 5,813​$ 4,941​​​​​​​​​average shareholders' equity (including non-controlling interest) (2)​$ 11,500​$ 10,198​average short-term and long-term debt (3)​  20,413​  17,982​average invested capital​$ 31,913​$ 28,180​​​​​​​​​return on invested capital (non-gaap measure)​​ 18.2%​ 17.5%​​​​​​​​(1) effective income tax rate used for interest expense​​ 19.6%​ 19.8%​​​​​​​​(2) calculation of average equity (includes non-controlling interest)​​​​​​​ending total equity as of:​​​​​​​march 31​$ 10,209​$ 9,757​june 30​​ 10,915​​ 10,142​september 30​​ 11,943​​ 10,764​december 31​  12,931​  10,126​average total equity​$ 11,500​$ 10,198​​​​​​​​​(3) calculation of average debt​​​​​​​ending short-term and long-term debt as of:​​​​​​​march 31​$ 22,495​$ 16,370​june 30​​ 20,762​​ 15,806​september 30​​ 19,598​​ 19,439​december 31​  18,795​  20,313​average short-term and long-term debt​$ 20,413​$ 17,982​​cash flows:​cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.​​47

therefore, the long-term portion of the total net tax liability of $933 million is excluded from the preceding table. in addition, the transition tax prescribed under the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) is separately included in the table above. refer to note 10 for further details. additionally, included within the caption entitled “unconditional purchase obligations and other” are operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced, which as of december 31, 2020, totaled approximately $18 million. these commitments pertain to 3m’s right of use buildings.​as discussed in note 13, the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2021 and company contributions to its u.s. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.​financial instruments​the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.​refer to item 7a, “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.​item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.​in the context of item 7a, 3m is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. changes in those factors could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition. senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the company’s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.​the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. however, the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.​foreign exchange rates risk:​foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3m is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the u.s. dollar. the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the 52
table of contentseffect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3m may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. the maximum length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. in addition, 3m enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. as circumstances warrant, the company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the company’s net investments in foreign operations. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $2.3 billion at december 31, 2020. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $3.2 billion at december 31, 2020. in addition, as of december 31, 2020, the company had 3.5 billion euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in note 14 in the “net investment hedges” section.​interest rates risk:​the company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3m manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. in addition, the company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. the dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the company’s interest rate swaps at december 31, 2020 was $403 million. additional details about 3m’s long-term debt can be found in note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in note 14, associated with the company’s long-term debt.​commodity prices risk:​the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. the related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. ​value at risk:​the value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the company’s sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to debt instruments, interest rate derivatives and underlying foreign exchange and commodity exposures outstanding at december 31, 2020. the model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. the exposure to changes in currency rates model used nine currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. this model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company. this model does not include foreign currency hedges, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​adverse impact on after-tax​positive impact on after-tax ​​earnings​earnings (millions)    2020    2019    2020    2019 foreign exchange rates​$ (169)​$ (133)​$ 175​$ 137​interest rates​  (1)​  (11)​  2​  10​commodity prices​  —​  (2)​  —​  1​​an analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. a one percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $70 million per year. the global energy exposure is such that a ten 53

described in note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses around markets and customers. additionally, the company consolidated the way it presents geographic area net sales by providing an aggregate americas geographic region (combining former united states and latin america and canada areas). also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3m’s chief operating decision maker changed and, as a result, the company’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss has been updated. information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.​foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the united states with the exception of 3m’s subsidiaries in argentina, the economy of which was considered highly inflationary beginning in 2018, and accordingly the financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.​3m had a consolidating subsidiary in venezuela, the financial statements of which were remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent because venezuela’s economic environment is considered highly inflationary. the operating income of this subsidiary was immaterial as a percent of 3m’s consolidated operating income for the periods presented. in light of circumstances, including the country’s unstable environment and heightened unrest leading to sustained lack of demand, and expectation that these circumstances will continue for the foreseeable future, during may 2019, 3m concluded it no longer met the criteria of control in order to continue consolidating its venezuelan operations. as a result, as of may 31, 2019, the company began reflecting its interest in the venezuelan subsidiary as an equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. this resulted in a pre-tax charge of $162 million within other expense (income) in the second quarter of 2019. the charge primarily relates to $144 million of foreign currency translation losses associated with foreign currency movements before venezuela was accounted for as a highly inflationary economy and pension elements previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss along with write-down of intercompany receivable and investment balances associated with this subsidiary. beginning may 31, 2019, 3m’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations no longer include the venezuelan entity’s operations other than an immaterial equity investment and associated loss or income thereon largely only to the extent, if any, that 3m provides support or materials and receives funding or dividends.​use of estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. the company considered the coronavirus (covid-19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate, within its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. 3m believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving consideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic. such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.​cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.​marketable securities: marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (fifo) method. the classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the 62
table of contentsavailability for use in current operations. 3m reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by asc 320, investments-debt securities and asc 326-30, available-for-sale debt securities, when determining whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. an impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. the allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. a change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity. the factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. when a credit loss exists, the company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.​investments: all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3m utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. the balance of these securities is disclosed in note 7.​other assets: other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term assets. investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in “purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,” respectively.​inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (nrv), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.​property, plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3m records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.​conditional asset retirement obligations: a liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the company. the obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. the asset retirement obligation liability was $145 million and $137 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.​goodwill: goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is 63
table of contentstested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “step 0”. 3m has chosen not to apply step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.​intangible assets: intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from four to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. the estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between ten to twenty years, patents largely between seven to twenty years, other technology-based largely between four to twenty years, definite lived tradenames largely between six and twenty years, and other intangibles largely between five to eight years. intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. refer to note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the company’s intangible assets. costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within “research, development and related expenses.”​intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the asset’s or asset group’s ongoing use and eventual disposition. if an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.​intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.​restructuring actions: restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. these charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees’ remaining service periods. contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company. asset impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.​revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. the vast majority of 3m’s customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. however, to a limited extent 3m also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.​the company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of accounting standards codification (asc) 606, revenue from contracts with customers. revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. for the majority of the company’s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally 64
table of contentswhen legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfers to the customer. in limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3m completes the performance obligation(s).​revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the company expects to be entitled. when determining the transaction price, 3m estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under asc 606. the main sources of variable consideration for 3m are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. these sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. the most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. the range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. because 3m serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. there are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3m primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. the company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.​for substantially all arrangements recognized over time, the company applies the “right to invoice” practical expedient. as a result, 3m recognizes revenue at the invoice amount when the entity has a right to invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the company’s performance completed to date.​for contracts with multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using 3m’s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.​the company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.​the company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. additionally, the company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.​3m applies asc 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:●exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less.●practical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. ●portfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration.●“right to invoice” practical expedient based on 3m’s right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3m’s performance completed to date.●election to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.●sales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required remaining performance obligations disclosure​the company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in accordance with the guidance of asc 842, leases. the company recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. the leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.​accounts receivable and allowances: trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. the company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. the allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. the company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data, current expectations of future credit losses, and historical cash discounts. the company reviews the allowances monthly. the 65
table of contentsallowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. the company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. the company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. these long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.​advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $278 million in 2020, $348 million in 2019 and $396 million in 2018.​research, development and related expenses: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of income. research, development and related expenses totaled $1.878 billion in 2020, $1.911 billion in 2019 and $1.821 billion in 2018. research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.146 billion in 2020, $1.253 billion in 2019 and $1.253 billion in 2018. related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in r&d-related ventures.​internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the software’s use. amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.​environmental: environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the company’s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.​income taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the company had valuation allowances of $135 million and $158 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. the company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under asc 740, income taxes. ​earnings per share: the difference in the weighted average 3m shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the company’s stock-based compensation plans. certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (18.1 million average options for 2020, 8.9 million average options for 2019, and 2.9 million average options for 2018). the computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 follow:​66

expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (rsus), performance shares, and the general employees’ stock purchase plan (gespp). under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. however, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award’s intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for rsus), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. these excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. the extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3m stock price and timing/extent of rsu vestings and employee stock option exercises. ​comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments. the company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.​derivatives and hedging activities: all derivative instruments within the scope of asc 815, derivatives and hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.​credit risk: the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. however, the company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3m enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. a master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3m entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3m has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.​fair value measurements: 3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the 67
table of contentsamount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. the standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.​acquisitions: the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805, business combinations. this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting. in addition to business combinations, 3m periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. these transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity. ​leases: 3m determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. the right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3m determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3m does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. examples of such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.​after adoption of asu 2016-02 and related standards in 2019, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. the discount rate used to calculate present value is 3m’s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3m determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.​as a lessee, the company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. certain 3m lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3m’s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.​certain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3m includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the company will exercise the option. in addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. in general, 3m is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.​for the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3m groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancelable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. certain 3m leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.​​68
table of contentsnew accounting pronouncements​in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which revised guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and through march 2020 issued asus that amended the standard (asu no. 2018-19, asu no. 2019-04, asu no. 2019-05, asu no. 2019-11, and asu no. 2020-03). the new standard introduced an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modified the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. the new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. with respect to available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, the asu amended the current other-than-temporary impairment model. for such securities with unrealized losses, entities still consider if a portion of any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a reduction in income. however, rather than also reflecting that credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that afs debt security, the asu requires that credit losses be reflected as an allowance. as a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous allowances, or portions thereof, reversing back into income. for 3m, this asu was effective january 1, 2020. adoption of this asu did not have a material impact due to the nature and extent of 3m’s financial instruments in scope for this asu (primarily accounts receivable) and the historical, current and expected credit quality of its customers as of the date of adoption.​in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-15, customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract, which aligned the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement (i.e. hosting arrangement) with the guidance on capitalizing costs in asc 350-40, internal-use software. the asu permitted either a prospective or retrospective transition approach. for 3m, the asu was effective as of january 1, 2020, with the company adopting on a prospective basis. relevant capitalizable costs are included in prepaid expenses or other non-current assets, as applicable, prospectively beginning in 2020. implementation costs incurred as part of 3m’s cloud-computing service arrangements were not material in 2020.​in december 2019, the fasb issued asu no. 2019-12, simplifying the accounting for income taxes (topic 740). this asu simplifies the accounting for income taxes by, among other things, eliminating certain existing exceptions related to the general approach in asc 740 relating to franchise taxes, reducing complexity in the interim-period accounting for year-to-date loss limitations and changes in tax laws, and clarifying the accounting for transactions outside of business combination that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. the transition requirements are primarily prospective and the effective date for 3m is january 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. as 3m does not have material activity associated with items such as franchise taxes or the types of transactions described above, does not typically have entities subject to relevant loss limitations and is not currently addressing enacted tax law changes for which this asu applies, 3m does not expect this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.​in january 2020, the fasb issued asu no. 2020-01, clarifying the interactions between topic 321, investments—equity securities, topic 323, investments—equity method and joint ventures, and topic 815, derivatives and hedging. this asu clarifies that when accounting for certain equity securities, a company should consider observable transactions before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative. further,

by government health care programs. the cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with u.s. amounts in the tables that follow.​the company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. for its u.s. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.​the company also sponsors employee savings plans under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. these plans are offered to substantially all regular u.s. employees. for eligible employees hired prior to january 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. employees hired on or after january 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. all contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. employer contributions to the u.s. defined contribution plans were $201 million, $186 million and $173 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 3m subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $103 million, $96 million and $99 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.​in may 2019 (as part of the 2019 restructuring actions discussed in note 5), the company began offering a voluntary early retirement incentive program to certain eligible participants of its u.s. pension plans who meet age and years of pension service requirements. the eligible participants who accepted the offer and retired by july 1, 2019 received an enhanced pension benefit. pension benefits were enhanced by adding one additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. approximately 800 participants accepted the offer and retired before july 1, 2019. as a result, the company incurred a $35 million charge related to these special termination benefits in the second quarter of 2019.91
table of contentsin the fourth quarter of 2019, the company recognized a non-operating $32 million settlement expense in its u.s. non-qualified pension plan. the charge is related to lump sum payments made to employees at retirement. the settlement expense is an accelerated recognition of past actuarial losses.​in may 2019, 3m modified the 3m retiree life insurance plan postretirement benefit to close it to new participants effective august 1, 2019 (which results in employees who retire on or after august 1, 2019 not being eligible to participate in the plan) and reducing the maximum life insurance and death benefit to $8,000 for deaths on or after august 1, 2019. due to these changes, the plan was re-measured in the second quarter of 2019, resulting in a decrease to the accumulated projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $150 million and a related increase to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated other comprehensive income in addition to an immaterial income statement benefit prospectively.​in the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business, the company recognized a curtailment in its united kingdom pension plan. the resulting re-measurement of the pension plan funded status reduced long-term prepaid pension and post retirement assets (located within “other assets” of the company’s balance sheet) by approximately $80 million, which was offset within accumulated other comprehensive income (located within the equity section of the company’s balance sheet). the expense impact of this re-measurement was immaterial for the second quarter of 2020 and subsequent periods.​the following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 of the respective years. 3m also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. the obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the company’s consolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $40 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​qualified and non-qualified​​​​​​ ​​pension benefits​postretirement ​​united states​international​benefits (millions)    2020    2019    2020    2019    2020    2019 change in benefit obligation​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​benefit obligation at beginning of year​$ 17,935​$ 15,948​$ 7,931​$ 6,965​$ 2,242​$ 2,175​acquisitions/transfers​  —​  —​  1​  9​  —​  —​service cost ​  261​  251​  152​  131​  43​  43​interest cost ​  499​  620​  117​  156​  62​  82​participant contributions​  —​  —​  9​  7​  —​  —​foreign exchange rate changes​  —​  —​  427​  55​  (14)​  —​plan amendments​  —​  —​  —​  3​  —​  (171)​actuarial (gain) loss​  1,785​  2,209​  464​  906​  176​  225​benefit payments​  (1,104)​  (1,128)​  (274)​  (302)​  (107)​  (112)​settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other​  —​  35​  (57)​  1​​ (5)​  —​benefit obligation at end of year​$ 19,376​$ 17,935​$ 8,770​$ 7,931​$ 2,397​$ 2,242​change in plan assets​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​fair value of plan assets at beginning of year​$ 16,099​$ 14,803​$ 6,923​$ 6,170​$ 1,338​$ 1,260​acquisitions/transfers​​ —​​ —​​ —​​ 4​​ —​​ —​actual return on plan assets​  2,071​  2,323​  1,102​  858​  147​  187​company contributions​  61​  101​  92​  106​  3​  3​participant contributions​  —​  —​  9​  7​  —​  —​foreign exchange rate changes​  —​  —​  376​  80​  —​  —​benefit payments​  (1,104)​  (1,128)​  (274)​  (302)​  (107)​  (112)​settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other​  —​  —​  (34)​  —​  (5)​  —​fair value of plan assets at end of year​$ 17,127​$ 16,099​$ 8,194​$ 6,923​$ 1,376​$ 1,338​funded status at end of year​$ (2,249)​$ (1,836)​$ (576)​$ (1,008)​$ (1,021)​$ (904)​​​​92

table of contentsthe company provides eligible retirees in the u.s. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings account benefits-based plan. the contributions provided by the company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to january 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after january 1, 2016. therefore, the company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.​the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. using this methodology, the company determined a discount rate of 2.55% for the u.s. pension plans and 2.50% for the postretirement benefit plans as of december 31, 2020, which is a decrease of 0.70 percentage points and 0.77 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of december 31, 2019. a decrease in the discount rate increases the projected benefit obligation (pbo), the significant decrease in the discount rate as of december 31, 2020 resulted in an approximately $1.8 billion higher benefit obligation for the u.s. pension and postretirement plans. ​the company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.​for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 6.75% in 2020. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. as of december 31, 2020, the company’s 2021 expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is 6.50%. the expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. the 2020 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 22% global equities, 12% private equities, 49% fixed-income securities, and 17% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. the actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2020 was 13.6%. in 2019 the plan earned a rate of return of 16.3% and in 2018 earned a return of -0.5%. the average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 8.8% and 9.0%, respectively. return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. ​as of december 31, 2019, the company converted to the “pri-2012 aggregate mortality table”. in 2020, the company updated the mortality improvement scales to the society of actuaries scale mp-2020. the december 31, 2020 update resulted in an immaterial decrease to the u.s. pension pbo and u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.​during 2020, the company contributed $153 million to its u.s. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. during 2019, the company contributed $207 million to its u.s. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. in 2021, the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its u.s. and international retirement plans. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2021. future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.​95

table of contentsnote 16. commitments and contingencies​unconditional purchase obligations:​unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-cancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). the company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment (for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of december 31, 2020, at $985 million. payments by year are estimated as follows: 2021 ($294 million), 2022 ($328 million), 2023 ($216 million), 2024 ($95 million), 2025 ($46 million) and after 2026 ($6 million). many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. the company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated. the majority of 3m’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the company’s expected future cash outflows related to purchases.​warranties/guarantees:​3m’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $46 million at december 31, 2020, and $51 million at december 31, 2019. further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as the company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.​related party activity:​3m does not have any material related party activity.​legal proceedings:​the company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the united states, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. these claims, lawsuits and proceedings include, but are not limited to, products liability (involving products that the company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal false claims act, securities, and state and federal environmental laws. unless otherwise stated, the company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. from time to time, the company also receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies. the company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. these responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the company. such subpoenas and requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil or criminal legal proceedings against the company and others, as well as to settlements. the outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. any determination that the company’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.​process for disclosure and recording of liabilities related to legal proceedings​many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. when making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the company complies with the requirements of asc 450, contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when liability is probable. where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. the company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.​111
table of contentsbecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. many of the matters described are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. it is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. a future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. although the company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, the company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings or future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company. based on experience and developments, the company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. where appropriate, the company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. as a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the future.​process for disclosure and recording of insurance receivables related to legal proceedings​the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. for those insured legal proceedings where the company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company’s insurance program. for those insured matters where the company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.​the following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.​respirator mask/asbestos litigation​as of december 31, 2020, the company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 2,075 individual claimants, compared to approximately 1,727 individual claimants with actions pending on december 31, 2019.​the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company’s mask and respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. as of year-end 2020, there has been an increase in the number of cases filed alleging injuries from exposures to coal mine dust. a minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at company premises.​the company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. the company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. over the past twenty plus years, the company has prevailed in fifteen of the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). in 2018, 3m received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in california state court in february and the other in massachusetts state court in december – both involving allegations that 3m respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. in april 2018, a jury in state court in kentucky found 3m’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. in august 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the company appealed. during march and april 2019, the company agreed in principle to settle a substantial majority of the coal mine dust lawsuits in kentucky and west virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in april 2018 in the kentucky case mentioned above. that settlement was completed in 2019, and the appeal has been dismissed. in october 2020, 3m defended a respirator case before a jury in king county, washington, involving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3m’s 8710 112
table of contentsrespirator was defective and that 3m acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. the jury delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3m, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3m was not a cause of plaintiff’s mesothelioma. the plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal.​the company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. consequently, the company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the company’s respiratory protection products. nonetheless, the company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.​as previously reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney general, filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. the amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. in october 2019, the court granted the state’s motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim. in january 2020, the manufacturers filed a petition with the west virginia supreme court, challenging the trial court’s rulings; that petition was denied in november 2020. no liability has been recorded for this matter because the company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. in addition, the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the state of west virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case, and the assertions of claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.​respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and insurance receivables​the company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. the company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the “claims data”). as part of its comprehensive legal review, the company regularly provides the claims data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of claims data on future filing trends and costs. the third party assists the company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. the company uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability. ​developments may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of its liabilities. these developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the company’s accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.​as a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the company increased its accruals in 2020 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by a total of $120 million. in 2020, the company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $66 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. during the first quarter of 2019, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $313 million in conjunction with an increase in the accrual as a result of the march and april 2019 settlements-in-principle of the coal mine dust lawsuits mentioned above and the company’s assessment of other current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits (including the costs to resolve all current and expected coal mine dust lawsuits in kentucky and west virginia). as of december 31, 2020, the company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding aearo accruals) of $662 million. this accrual represents the company’s best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the company approaching the year 2050. the company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are 113
table of contentstypically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the company’s estimate of liabilities.​as of december 31, 2020, the company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4 million. the company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. once those claims for coverage are resolved, the company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.​respirator mask/asbestos litigation — aearo technologies​on april 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the company acquired the stock of aearo holding corp., the parent of aearo technologies (“aearo”). aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products.​as of december 31, 2020, aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated aearo’s respirator business (american optical corporation, warner-lambert llc, ao corp. and cabot corporation (“cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. ​as of december 31, 2020, the company, through its aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $28 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future aearo-related asbestos,  silica-related and coal mine dust claims. this accrual represents the company’s best estimate of aearo’s probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against aearo approaching the year 2050. the accrual was reduced by $37 million during the second quarter of 2020 after paying aearo’s share of certain settlements under the informal arrangement described below. the accrual reflects the company’s assessment of pending and expected lawsuits, its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, and the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries. responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo, cabot, american optical corporation and a subsidiary of warner lambert and their respective insurers (the “payor group”). liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “ao safety” brand and/or owned the ao safety division of american optical corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. ​aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july 11, 1995. this agreement provides that, so long as aearo pays to cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to july 11, 1995. because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to january 1, 1997. with these arrangements in place, aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after january 1, 1997. to date, aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-july 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with cabot if aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.​developments may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo’s liabilities. these developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the payor group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of aearo’s share of liability for these existing and future claims. if any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.​114
table of contentsbecause of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the payor group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo’s liabilities, the company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the company has established.​environmental matters and litigation​the company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the united states and abroad. these laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.​under certain environmental laws, including the united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980 (cercla) and similar state laws, the company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. the company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the united states, at which it may have some liability. please refer to the section entitled “environmental liabilities and insurance receivables” that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.​environmental matters​as previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (pfoa), perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos), perfluorohexane sulfonate (pfhxs), or other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively pfas). as a result of its phase-out decision in may 2000, the company no longer manufactures certain pfas compounds including pfoa, pfos, pfhxs, and their pre-cursor compounds. the company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. the company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length pfas compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane sulfonate (pfbs). these compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the company’s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain pfas in purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3m’s current fluorochemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.​regulatory activities concerning pfas continue in the united states, europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. these activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. in the european union, where 3m has manufacturing facilities in countries such as germany and belgium, recent regulatory activities have included preliminary work on various restrictions under the regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach), including the restriction of pfas in certain usages and a broader restriction of pfas as a class. as of december 2020, pfoa is subject to certain restrictions under eu’s persistent organic pollutants (pops) recast regulation. ​in the united states, as the database of studies of both pfoa and pfos has expanded, the epa has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. in february 2014, the epa initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for pfoa and pfos. the peer review panel met in august 2014. in may 2016, the epa announced lifetime health advisory levels for pfoa and pfos at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established by the epa in 2009 of 400 ppt for pfoa and 200 ppt for pfos). where pfoa and pfos are found together, epa recommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for pfoa and pfos combined is also 70 ppt. lifetime health advisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at 115
table of contentswhich adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. to collect exposure information under the safe drinking water act, the epa published on may 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six pfas chemicals, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. through january 2017, the epa reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide. based on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for pfoa and 46 exceed the level for pfos (unchanged from the july 2016 epa summary). a technical advisory issued by epa in september 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public water supplies had exceeded the combined level for pfoa and pfos. these results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. epa reporting does not identify the sources of the pfoa and pfos in the public water supplies.​the company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of pfas-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at its decatur, alabama; cottage grove, minnesota; and cordova, illinois plants. as previously reported, the company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the alabama department of environmental management (adem) to remediate the presence of pfas in the soil and groundwater at the company’s manufacturing facility in decatur, alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998) incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. with adem’s agreement, 3m substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas. further remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance with the july 2020 interim consent order described below in the “other pfas-related matters” section.​the company continues to work with the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed may 2007 settlement agreement and consent order to address the presence of certain pfas in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury) and at the company’s manufacturing facility at cottage grove, minnesota. under this agreement, the company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain pfas from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a health based value (hbv) or health risk limit (hrl) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the minnesota department of health (mdh) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain pfas for which a hbv and/or hrl exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other pfas at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate pfoa and pfos; and (iv) sharing information with the mpca about certain perfluorinated compounds. during 2008, the mpca issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury). in august 2009, the mpca issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the company’s cottage grove manufacturing facility. during the spring and summer of 2010, 3m began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the cottage grove and woodbury sites. 3m commenced the remedial option at the oakdale site in late 2010. at each location the remedial options were recommended by the company and approved by the mpca. remediation work has been completed at the oakdale and woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. remediation work has been substantially completed at the cottage grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.​in august 2014, the illinois epa approved a request by the company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in cordova, illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.​in may 2017, the mdh issued new hbvs for pfoa and pfos. the new hbvs are 35 ppt for pfoa and 27 ppt for pfos. in connection with its announcement the mdh stated that “drinking water with pfoa and pfos, even at the levels above the updated values, does not represent an immediate health risk. these values are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state.” in december 2017, the mdh issued a new hbv for perfluorobutane sulfonate (pfbs) of 2 parts per billion (ppb). in february 2018, the mdh published reports finding no unusual rates of certain cancers or adverse birth outcomes (low birth rates or premature births) among residents of washington and dakota counties in minnesota. in april 2019, the mdh issued a new hbv for pfos of 15 ppt and a new hbv for pfhxs of 47 ppt.​in may 2018, the epa announced a four-step pfas action plan, which includes evaluating the need to set safe drinking water act maximum contaminant levels (mcls) for pfoa and pfos and beginning the steps necessary to designate pfoa and pfos as “hazardous substances” under cercla. in november 2018, the epa asked for public comment on draft toxicity assessments for two pfas compounds, including pfbs. in february 2019, the epa issued a pfas action plan that outlines short- and long-term actions the epa is taking to address pfas – actions that include developing a national drinking water determination for pfoa and pfos, 116

(taconic) as a defendant and make similar allegations related to taconic’s facility in neighboring petersburg. the plaintiffs seek unstated compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. 3m has answered the complaints in these cases, which are now proceeding through discovery. the plaintiffs in the putative class action have moved for class certification. 3m is also defending 11 individual cases in new york filed by nassau county drinking water providers in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york. the plaintiffs in these cases allege that 3m, dupont, and additional unnamed defendants are responsible for the contamination of plaintiffs’ water supply sources with various pfas compounds. dupont’s motion to transfer these cases to the afff mdl was denied in march 2020. 3m has filed answers in the eight cases in which it has been served. preliminary discovery is ongoing.​in michigan, one consolidated putative class action is pending in the u.s. district court for the western district of michigan against 3m and wolverine world wide (wolverine). the action arises from wolverine’s allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3m scotchgard, related to wolverine’s shoe manufacturing operations. plaintiffs allege wolverine used 3m scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3m’s product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. in january 2021, 3m moved to dismiss certain claims in the complaint, and the case remains in early stages of litigation. in addition to the consolidated federal court putative class action, as of december 31, 2020, 3m is a defendant in approximately 274 private individual actions in michigan state court based on similar allegations. these cases are coordinated for pre-trial purposes. five of these cases were selected over time for bellwether trials. in january 2020, the court issued the first round of dispositive motion rulings related to the first two bellwether cases, including dismissing the second bellwether case entirely and dismissing certain plaintiffs’ medical monitoring and risk of future disease claims, and granting summary judgment to the defendants on one plaintiff’s cholesterol injury claims. the parties settled the first bellwether case in early 2020. in june 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to reconsider the dismissal of the second bellwether case, and the plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the state appellate court. in january 2021, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants in one of three remaining bellwether cases. the remaining two bellwether trials are tentatively scheduled for october 2021, subject to covid-19 developments. the parties have engaged in mediation efforts in both the putative class action and the state court mass action cases.​wolverine also filed a third-party complaint against 3m in a suit by the state of michigan and intervenor townships that seeks to compel wolverine to investigate and address contamination associated with its historic disposal activity. 3m filed an answer and counterclaims to wolverine’s third-party complaint in june 2019. in september and october 2019, the parties (including 3m as third-party defendant) engaged in mediation. in december 2019, the state of michigan, the intervening townships, and wolverine announced that they had tentatively resolved the state and townships’ claims against wolverine in exchange for a $70 million payment and certain future remediation measures by wolverine. in february 2020, the court approved a consent decree that memorializes wolverine’s ongoing remediation obligations and the state’s and intervening townships’ covenants not to bring further lawsuits as to the remediated area. 3m has been formally designated as a “contributing party,” and as such, the state’s and townships’ covenants will also apply to 3m. in february 2020, 3m and wolverine executed an agreement to resolve the legal claims between the two companies. pursuant to the agreement, 3m made a one-time financial contribution of $55 million in march 2020 to support wolverine’s past and ongoing efforts to address pfas remediation under wolverine’s consent decree with the state and the townships. this amount was part of 3m’s charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 as discussed below in the “environmental liabilities and insurance receivables” section.​3m is also a defendant, together with georgia-pacific as co-defendant, in a putative class action in federal court in michigan brought by residents of parchment, who allege that the municipal drinking water is contaminated from waste generated by a paper mill owned by georgia-pacific’s corporate predecessor. the defendants moved to dismiss certain claims in the complaint, and that motion was 122
table of contentsdenied in january 2021. the parties continue to engage in discovery. as a result of discussions among georgia-pacific, 3m and municipalities near parchment, georgia-pacific and 3m have contributed to a fund of approximately $5 million to provide expanded municipal water service in the area. the municipalities have released 3m from claims relating to or arising out of the extension of municipal water or the alleged pfas contamination in the area of that extension. the putative class action claims are not included in this resolution. ​in alabama and georgia, 3m, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending four state court cases, including three brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3m’s sale of pfas-containing products to carpet manufacturers in georgia. the plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged pfas into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the coosa river, including rome, georgia and centre and gadsden, alabama. the three water utility cases remain in the early stages of litigation. one state court case was brought by individuals asserting pfas contamination by the georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of rome and floyd county water subscribers. this case has been removed to federal court, where 3m has filed a motion to dismiss a series of amended complaints. ​in california, 3m and other defendants are defending an action brought in federal court by golden state water company, alleging pfas contamination of certain wells located in its water systems. 3m filed a motion to dismiss in november 2020 and in january 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. in december 2020, the orange county water district and ten additional local water providers sued 3m, decra roofing and certain dupont-related entities in california state court, alleging pfas contamination of the plaintiffs’ water sources and also referring to 3m's industrial minerals facility in corona, california as a potential source of contamination. ​in delaware, 3m, together with several co-defendants, is defending one putative class action brought by individuals alleging pfas contamination of their water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. plaintiffs allege that 3m supplied pfas to the metal plating facilities. dupont, chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. this case has been removed from state court to federal court, and plaintiffs have withdrawn its motion to remand to state court and filed an amended complaint. 3m has filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.​in new jersey, 3m is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by middlesex water company, alleging pfas contamination of its water wells. 3m’s motion to transfer the case to the afff mdl was denied. 3m has moved to dismiss the complaint, and the case is currently in discovery. in addition, 3m, together with several co-defendants, is defending two federal court cases by multiple individuals with private drinking water wells near dupont and solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with pfas by 3m. plaintiffs seek medical monitoring and damages. 3m has filed a motion to dismiss in the first of those actions and the second is in early stages of litigation. 3m and other defendants are also defending three federal court cases brought by individuals who live near the dupont and solvay facilities, alleging personal injury caused by pfas exposure. those cases are in early stages of litigation. in september 2020, a federal court case was filed against 3m on behalf of the borough of hopatcong, alleging general pfas contamination of its public water supply. in december 2020, 3m filed a motion to dismiss the hopatcong matter.​in october 2018, 3m and other defendants, including dupont and chemours, were named in a putative class action in the u.s. district court for the southern district of ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to pfas chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting to represent a putative class of all u.s. individuals with detectable levels of pfas in their blood. the plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order “establishing an independent panel of scientists” to evaluate pfas. 3m and other entities jointly filed a motion to dismiss in february 2019. in september 2019, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. in february 2020, the court denied 3m’s motion to transfer the case to the afff mdl. in december 2020, the defendants filed their joint opposition to the class certification motion filed earlier by the plaintiff. ​in west virginia, 3m and other defendants are defending a state court action brought by weirton area water board that alleges pfas contamination of local water supplies. this case has been removed to federal court. the defendants filed various motions to dismiss the complaint based on pleading deficiencies and lack of personal jurisdiction. in november 2020, the court granted some of the personal jurisdiction motions, denied other personal jurisdiction motions (including 3m’s) and ordered the remaining parties to engage in discovery on jurisdiction. in december 2020, the court denied the defendants’ non-jurisdictional motion to dismiss. the case remains in early stages of litigation.​123

and (ii) remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies. obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the consent order will involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. the company does not expect them to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. with respect to remediation activities, financial obligations related to certain activities under the consent order are probable and estimable, and are included in the company’s accruals for “other environmental liabilities” as described in the “environmental liabilities and insurance receivables” section below. as offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and estimable in the future.​in december 2019, the company received a grand jury subpoena from the u.s. attorney’s office for the northern district of alabama for documents related to, among other matters, the company’s compliance with the 2009 tsca consent order and unpermitted discharges to the tennessee river. the company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents in response to the subpoena.​in addition, as part of its ongoing evaluation of regulatory compliance at its cordova, illinois facility, the company discovered it had not fully characterized its pfas discharge in its npdes permit for the cordova facility. in november 2019, the company disclosed this matter to the epa, and in january 2020 disclosed this matter to the illinois environmental protection agency (iepa). the company continues to work with the epa and iepa to address these issues from the cordova facility. in december 2020, the epa requested certain documents and information related to tsca compliance at the facility. the company is cooperating and producing documents and information in response to the request.​124
table of contentsthe company is also reviewing operations at its other plants with similar manufacturing processes, such as the plant in cottage grove, minnesota, to ensure those operations are in compliance with applicable environmental regulatory requirements and company policies and procedures. as a result of these reviews, the company discovered it had not fully characterized its pfas discharge in its npdes permit for the cottage grove facility. in march 2020, the company disclosed this matter to the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) and the epa. in july 2020, the company received an information request from mpca for documents and information related to, among other matters, the company’s compliance with the clean water act at its cottage grove facility. the company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information in response to the request for information. the company continues to work with the mpca and epa to address the discharges from the cottage grove facility.​separately, in june 2020, the company reported to epa and mpca that it had not fully complied with elements of the inspection, characterization and waste stream profile verification process of the waste and feedstream analysis plan (wap/fap) of its resource conservation and recovery act (rcra) permit for its cottage grove incinerator. in july 2020, the company received an information request from mpca related to the june 2020 disclosure, to which the company responded in september 2020. the company continues to work with the mpca to address wap/fap implementation issues disclosed in june 2020. in january 2021, the company received a notice of violation (nov) from mpca related to, among other matters, the above-described clean water act and rcra issues.  the company is cooperating with mpca to address the issues that are the subject of the nov.​in february 2020, the company received an information request from epa for documents and information related to, among other matters, the company’s compliance with the clean water act at its facilities that manufacture, process and use pfas, including the decatur, cordova and cottage grove facilities. the company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information in response to the request for information.​the company will continue to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including epa, the u.s. department of justice, state environmental agencies and state attorneys general) as it conducts these reviews. the company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters or what potential actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies.​other environmental litigation​in july 2018, the company, along with more than 120 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the cleaning up of approximately eight miles of the lower passaic river in new jersey. the plaintiff, occidental chemical corporation, alleges that it agreed to design and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including pcbs and dioxins. the complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the company. the company’s involvement in the case relates to its past use of two commercial drum conditioning facilities in new jersey. whether, and to what extent, the company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined.​for environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise stated, no liability has been recorded as the company believes liability in those matters is not probable and estimable and the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time. the company’s environmental liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.​environmental liabilities and insurance receivables​the company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and estimable based on experience and developments in those matters. during 2020, the company increased its accrual for pfas-related other environmental liabilities by $96 million and made related payments of $125 million. during the first quarter of 2019, the epa issued its pfas action plan and the company settled the litigation with the water authority (both matters are described in more detail above). the company completed a comprehensive review with the assistance of environmental consultants and other experts regarding environmental matters and litigation related to historical pfas manufacturing operations in minnesota; alabama; gendorf, germany; and at four former landfills in alabama. as a result of these developments and of that review, the company increased its accrual for “other environmental liabilities” by $235 million pre-tax (including the settlement with the water authority) in the first quarter of 2019. during the fourth quarter of 2019, 3m updated its evaluation of certain customer-related litigation based on continued, productive settlement discussions with multiple parties. as previously disclosed, 3m has been engaged in mediation and resolution negotiations in multiple cases. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company updated its assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to its historical pfas manufacturing operations and expanded 125
table of contentsits evaluation of other 3m sites that may have used certain pfas-containing materials and locations at which they were disposed. as a result of these actions during the fourth quarter the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $214 million. as of december 31, 2020, the company had recorded liabilities of $416 million for “other environmental liabilities.” the accruals represent the company’s best estimate of the probable loss. the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.​as of december 31, 2020, the company had recorded liabilities of $23 million for estimated non-pfas related “environmental remediation” costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3m manufacturing or third-party sites. the company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the company’s commitment to a plan of action. liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.​it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. developments may occur that could affect the company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. for sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. however, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.​the company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. as of december 31, 2020, the company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the environmental matters and litigation was $8 million. various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers’ purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.​product liability litigation​aearo technologies sold dual-ended combat arms – version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3m acquired aearo technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. in december 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3m in the san bernardino superior court in california alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3m’s dual-ended combat arms earplugs – version 2. the plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. the plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages. ​as of december 31, 2020, the company is a named defendant in approximately 3,130 lawsuits (including 14 putative class actions) in various state and federal courts that purport to represent approximately 12,400 individual claimants making similar allegations. in april 2019, the u.s. judicial panel on multidistrict litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the u.s. district court for the northern district of florida to be managed in a multi-district litigation (mdl) proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. discovery is underway. the plaintiffs and 3m filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. in july 2020, based on the then current record, the court granted the plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion and denied the defendants’ summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs’ claims are not barred by the government contractor defense. the court denied the company’s request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the 126

other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts. ​the u.s. judicial panel on multidistrict litigation (jpml) consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation (mdl) proceeding. in july 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs’ causation experts, and granted summary judgment for 3m in all cases pending at that time in the mdl. plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit. plaintiffs have also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3m in the first bellwether trial in the mdl and appealed the dismissal of another bellwether case. ​among the 23 remaining lawsuits in the united states, 20 are in the mdl court and three are in state court. the mdl court declined to remand one case to oklahoma state court and has stayed all 20 remaining lawsuits pending the appeal of the summary judgment decision. in february 2020, the mdl court remanded two cases to state court in jackson county, missouri that combined bair hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. there is also one case in hidalgo county, texas that combines bair hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. in august 2019, the mdl court enjoined the individual plaintiff from pursuing his claims in texas state court because he had previously filed and dismissed a claim in the mdl. that plaintiff has appealed

table of contents3m discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3m operating income and income before taxes. business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in “elimination of dual credit”). business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in “corporate and unallocated”). additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within corporate and unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses (see note 3), and divestiture-related restructuring actions (see note 5).​in addition, effective in the first quarter of 2020, in a continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around customers and markets, the company made the following changes:​continued alignment of customer account activity●as part of 3m’s regular customer-focus initiatives, the company realigned certain customer account activity (“sales district”) to correlate with the primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3m businesses. this largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3m business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. this dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. as a result of this change, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales and operating income for the total year 2019 decreased $42 million and $10 million, respectively, offset by corresponding decreases in the “elimination of dual credit” net sales and operating income amounts.​additional actions impacting product line alignments●the remaining retail auto care product lines formerly in the automotive aftermarket division (within the safety and industrial business segment), were realigned to the construction and home improvement division (within the consumer business segment). this change resulted in a decrease of previously reported net sales and operating income for total year 2019 of $35 million and $11 million, respectively, in the safety and industrial business segment, offset by a corresponding increase in net sales and operating income within the consumer business segment.●in addition, certain product lines were realigned within business segments. the transdermal drug delivery components business, formerly included in the drug delivery systems division, was realigned to the medical solutions division (both of which are within the health care business segment) and the paint protection film business, formerly included in the automotive and aerospace division, was realigned to the commercial solutions division (both of which are within the transportation and electronics business segment).​the financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.​134

table of contentswith a single reporting unit, as opposed to an estimate of underlying asset usage. new codm reporting of depreciation is as described above. with respect to assets in codm reporting, previously certain assets used by multiple segments were “split” in terms of determining the balances associated with each business segment (new reporting aligns the entire asset to a single primary user), certain shared manufacturing assets were retained in corporate and unallocated, and a number of other assets were allocated to the business segments. the impact of these changes has been reflected in the above table for all periods presented.​corporate and unallocatedcorporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments and is disclosed as ‘other corporate expense-net”. additionally, corporate and unallocated includes special items such as significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses (see note 3), and divestiture-related restructuring costs (see note 5). corporate and unallocated also includes sales, costs, and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of all of the communication markets division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former drug delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.​elimination of dual credit3m business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. management evaluates each of its four business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. as a result, 3m reflects additional (“dual”) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. this additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. for example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the display materials and systems division within the transportation and electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. in this example, the non-primary selling segment (consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. the assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. the offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “elimination of dual credit,” such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.​geographic information​geographic area information is used by the company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made. refer to note 2 for geographic net sales.​​​​​​​​​​​property, plant and ​​equipment - net (millions)    2020    2019 americas​$ 5,752​$ 5,873​asia pacific​  1,662​  1,637​europe, middle east and africa​  2,007​  1,823​total company​$ 9,421​$ 9,333​​united states net property, plant and equipment (pp&e) was $5,358 and $5,442 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. china/hong kong net property, plant and equipment (pp&e) was $583 million and $553 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.​137
