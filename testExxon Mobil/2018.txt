part i

item 1.        business 

exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of
new jersey in 1882. divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or
market products in the united states and most other countries of the world.
their principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil
and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil,
natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty
products. affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in
support of these businesses. 

exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds
of affiliates, many with names that include exxonmobil, exxon, esso,
mobil or xto. for convenience and simplicity, in this report the
terms exxonmobil, exxon, esso, mobil and xto, as well as terms
like corporation, company, our, we  and its,
are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups
of affiliates. the precise meaning depends on the context in question. 

the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. there is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial
and individual consumers. the corporation competes with other firms in the sale
or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes. 

operating data and industry segment information for the
corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the
following: “quarterly information”, “note 18: disclosures about segments
and related information” and “operating information”. information on oil and
gas reserves is contained in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the
“supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities”
portion of the financial section of this report.

exxonmobil has a long‑standing commitment to the
development of proprietary technology. we have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments.
exxonmobil held nearly 13 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of
2018. for technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $119 million
in 2018. although technology is an important contributor to the overall
operations and results of our company, the profitability of each business
segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license,
franchise or concession.

the number of regular employees was 71.0 thousand,
69.6 thousand, and 71.1 thousand at years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. regular employees are defined as active executive, management,
professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for
the corporation and are covered by the corporation’s benefit plans and
programs.

throughout exxonmobil’s businesses, new and ongoing
measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on
air, water and ground. these include a significant investment in refining
infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well
as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and
greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum
institute, exxonmobil’s 2018 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such
preventative and remediation steps, including exxonmobil’s share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.9 billion, of which $3.6 billion were
included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. the total cost
for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $5.7 billion
in 2019 and 2020. capital expenditures are expected to account for
approximately 30 percent of the total. 

information concerning the source and availability of raw
materials used in the corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in the
business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations
may be found in “item 1a. risk factors” and “item 2. properties” in this
report. 

exxonmobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. our
annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current
reports on form 8-k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to section 13(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 are made
available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we
electronically file or furnish the reports to the securities and exchange
commission (sec). also available on the corporation’s website are the company’s
corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics and business conduct, as
well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of
the board of directors. information on our website is not incorporated into
this report.

the sec maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov)
that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec.

item 1a.        risk
factors

exxonmobil’s financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. many of these risk factors are not within the
company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results, or our financial condition. these risk factors include: 

 

supply and
demand 

the oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. this means exxonmobil’s operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical
prices and by changes in margins on refined products. oil, gas, petrochemical,
and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global
events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. any
material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse
effect on certain of the company’s operations, especially in the upstream
segment, financial condition, and proved reserves. on the other hand, a
material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse
effect on certain of the company’s operations, especially in the downstream and
chemical segments.

economic conditions. the demand for energy and petrochemicals is
generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities and levels of
prosperity. the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative
economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results.
other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a
major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil
unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations,
can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. sovereign debt
downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal
constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal,
monetary, or political systems such as the european union, and other events or
conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions
also pose risks to exxonmobil, including risks to the safety of our financial
assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their
commitments to exxonmobil.

other demand-related factors. other factors that may affect the demand
for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include
technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns;
increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources; changes in technology
or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as technological advances
in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power
generation or increased consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric vehicles;
and broad-based changes in personal income levels. 

other supply-related factors. commodity prices and margins also vary
depending on a number of factors affecting supply. for example, increased
supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies
to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to
the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in
demand. similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical
manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the
affected products. world oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be
affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by countries
to opec production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, and the occurrence
of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors’
operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution
channels that may disrupt supplies. technological change can also alter the
relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to
manufacture petrochemicals. 

other market factors. exxonmobil’s business results are also
exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates,
inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market
conditions. 

 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political
or regulatory developments affecting our operations. 

access limitations. a number of countries limit access to
their oil and gas resources, or may place resources off-limits from development
altogether. restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend
to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national governments may
have less need of outside sources of private capital. many countries also
restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin. 

restrictions on doing business. exxonmobil is subject to laws and
sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do
business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing
business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be
conducted. such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors
who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. 

lack of legal certainty. some countries in which we do business
lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or may be unable to
maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. lack of
legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or
unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult
for us to enforce our contracts. in some cases these risks can be partially
offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the
adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce
an award. 





2 








 



regulatory
and litigation risks. even
in countries with well-developed legal systems where exxonmobil does business,
we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law (including
changes that result from international treaties and accords) that could
adversely affect our results, such as: 

  


 
  
·        
    
  
 
increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty rates
(including retroactive claims);
  
 

  
·        
    
  
 
price controls;
  
 

  
·        
    
  
 
changes in environmental regulations or other laws that
increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business
opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling
operations, water use, methane emissions, hydraulic fracturing or plastics);
  
 

  
·        
    
  
 
adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards,
the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;
  
 

  
·        
    
  
 
adoption of government payment transparency regulations
that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial
information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure laws of
other countries; and
  
 

  
·        
    
  
 
government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the
official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms
unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
  
 




legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation
or other takings may be inadequate. 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation, especially in countries such as the united states in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or
regulations. 

security concerns. successful operation of particular
facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or
terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, and other local security concerns. such concerns
may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations
for a period of time. 

climate change and greenhouse gas
restrictions. due to
concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries have adopted,
or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. these include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes,
minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased
efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. such
policies could make our products more expensive, less competitive, lengthen
project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as
shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural
gas. current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also
increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering
emissions. 

government sponsorship of alternative
energy. many governments
are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy
sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. governments
and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost
and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. we are conducting
our own research both in-house and by working with more than 80 leading
universities around the world, including the massachusetts institute of
technology, princeton university, the university of texas, and stanford
university. our research projects focus on developing algae-based biofuels,
carbon capture and storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced
energy-saving materials, and other technologies. for example, exxonmobil is
working with fuel cell energy inc. to explore using carbonate fuel cells to
economically capture co2 emissions from gas-fired power plants. our
future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on
our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to
providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. see
“operational and other factors” below. 

 

operational and other factors

in addition to external economic and political factors, our
future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those
factors that are at least in part within our control. the extent to which we
manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. for
projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management
effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control. 

exploration and development program. our ability to maintain and grow our oil
and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development
efforts. among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to
identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management
expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget.

project and
portfolio management. the
long-term success of exxonmobil’s upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses
depends on complex, long‑term, capital intensive projects. these projects
in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize
efficiency. specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects
include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners,
governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir performance;
develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the
development of effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions
and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as
drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond
effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project
startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of
project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role. in addition to
the effective management of individual projects, exxonmobil’s success,
including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders,
depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including
diversification among types and locations of our projects. 

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a
variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning
as in any government payment transparency reports. 

operational efficiency. an important component of exxonmobil’s
competitive performance, especially given the commodity‑based nature of
many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our
ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis.
this requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements,
cost control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset
portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber
employees. 

research and development and technological
change. to maintain our
competitive position, especially in light of the technological nature of our
businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, exxonmobil’s
research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to
a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to
help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. to remain competitive we must also
continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies. 

safety, business controls, and
environmental risk management. our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the
inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control
effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential for human
error. we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace
safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events. for example,
we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations
integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and
comprehensive inspection and surveillance. similarly, we are implementing
cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce
air emissions, not only in response to government requirements but also to
address community priorities. we also maintain a disciplined framework of
internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring
compliance with this framework. substantial liabilities and other adverse
impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as
intended.

cybersecurity. exxonmobil is regularly subject to
attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including
state-sponsored actors. exxonmobil’s defensive preparedness includes
multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of
cybersecurity disruptions; non-technological measures such as threat
information sharing with governmental and industry groups; internal training
and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an
emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery. if the
measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be
insufficient, exxonmobil as well as our customers, employees, or third parties
could be adversely affected. cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical
harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business
systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result
in employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise
disrupt our business operations. we could incur significant costs to remedy the
effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection
with resulting regulatory actions, litigation or reputational harm. 

preparedness. our operations may be disrupted by severe
weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events. for
example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal
refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. our facilities are
designed, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic
and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of
engineering uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and
current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge
magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. our
consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in
design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other
events may potentially introduce. our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts
of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility
engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and
business continuity planning.

insurance limitations. the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the
risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the capacity of the
applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.

competition. as noted in item 1 above, the energy and
petrochemical industries are highly competitive. we face competition not only
from other private firms, but also from state-owned companies that are
increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries. in
some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance
of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on
financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as
exxonmobil. technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may
also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal
resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resource-owning
countries to partner with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to
monetize national resources.

reputation. our reputation is an important corporate
asset. an operating incident, significant cybersecurity disruption, or other
adverse event such as those described in this item 1a may have a negative
impact on our reputation, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to
compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory
approvals, or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products. exxonmobil’s
reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of
our industry as a whole.

projections, estimates, and descriptions of exxonmobil’s
plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1, 1a, 2, 7 and 7a of
this report are forward-looking statements. actual future results, including
project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs, and
business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the factors
discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

1. disclosure of reserves 

a. summary of oil and gas reserves at
year-end 2018 

the table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved
reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. natural gas is converted to an
oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels. the
corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. no
major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december
31, 2018, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved
reserves as of that date.

in the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and
equity company reserves are reported separately. however, the corporation
operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has
for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries. 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come
online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of
individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance;
performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact
of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on
production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital
investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and
other factors described in item 1a. risk factors. 

the estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the
requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous
technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis
of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures.
furthermore, the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which
have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the
development of the reserves. although the corporation is reasonably certain
that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be
affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects,
reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer
preferences, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price
levels. in addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of
low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending
and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects.

b. technologies used in
establishing proved reserves additions in 2018 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2018 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing
well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield
repeatable and consistent results. 

data used in these integrated assessments included
information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance
information. the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained
through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-d and 4-d seismic data,
calibrated with available well control information. the tools used to interpret
the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary
reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data
analysis packages. 

in some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs
were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase
the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 

c. qualifications of
reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that
provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization.
primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves
estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission (sec)
rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves. this group also maintains the
official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude
oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. in addition,
the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation
and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates. the manager of the
global reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir
engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in engineering and currently
serves on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum
engineers (spe). the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of
more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including
expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec
guidelines. this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either
engineering or geology. 

the global reserves group maintains a central database
containing the official company reserves estimates. appropriate controls,
including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place
to ensure data integrity within this central database. an annual review of the
system’s controls is performed by internal audit. key components of the
reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well
and field performance and a rigorous peer review. no changes may be made to the
reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new
initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have
been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the
operating organization. in addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed
certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level
of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made
in the central database. endorsement by the global reserves group for all
proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. after
all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final
endorsement.

2. proved undeveloped reserves  

at year-end 2018, approximately 7.9 billion oil-equivalent
barrels (goeb) of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved
undeveloped. this represents 32 percent of the 24.3 goeb reported in proved
reserves. this compares to the 7.3 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported
at the end of 2017. during the year, exxonmobil conducted development
activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 0.8 goeb from proved
undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. the largest transfers
were related to drilling activity in the united states, the united arab
emirates, canada, and russia. during 2018, extensions and discoveries,
primarily in the united states resulted in an addition of approximately 1.7
goeb of proved undeveloped reserves. also, the corporation reclassified
approximately 0.3 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the
sec definition of proved reserves, primarily in the netherlands at the
groningen gas field and the united states. 

overall, investments of $13.2 billion were made by the
corporation during 2018 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $13.1 billion for oil and gas producing
activities and additional investments for other non-oil and gas producing
activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related
facilities. these investments represented 65 percent of the $20.2 billion in
total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved
reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the
development of the reserves. exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy
and many major fields require long lead‑time in order to be developed.
development projects typically take several years from the time of recording
proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five
years for large and complex projects. proved undeveloped reserves in the united
states, canada, australia, and kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five
years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure,
as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects.
the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be
produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number
of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance,
regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co‑venturer/government
funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and
significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels. of the
proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years,
over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. in canada,
proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore
hebron field and onshore cold lake operations. in australia, proved undeveloped
reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng
project. in kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the
remainder of the initial development of the producing offshore kashagan field
which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the
tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz
– korolev field complex. the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and
proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as
approved development phases progress.

average production prices have been calculated by using
sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor. average
production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the
divisor. the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (ngl) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section
3.a. the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production
volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.a.
the natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in
the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental
information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of
the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. natural
gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one
thousand barrels.

b. exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas
resources extracted by mining technologies 

syncrude operations. syncrude is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32
degrees api), sweet, synthetic crude oil. imperial oil limited is the owner of
a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6 percent
interest in imperial oil limited. in 2018, the company’s share of net
production of synthetic crude oil was about 60 thousand barrels per day
and share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the athabasca oil
sands deposit. 

kearl operations. kearl is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen. imperial oil limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the
joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 29.04 percent.
exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in imperial oil limited and
a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties. kearl is comprised
of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the athabasca oil
sands deposit. 

kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of fort
mcmurray, alberta, canada. bitumen is extracted from oil sands and processed
through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. the product, a blend of
bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. diluent
is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude
bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. during 2018, average
net production at kearl was about 191 thousand barrels per day.

at year-end 2018, an additional 3.4 billion barrels of
bitumen at kearl qualified as proved reserves under the sec definition requiring
calculations based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price during
the last 12-month period.

and 8,053 net thousands of acres for 2017.

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped
acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. the terms and
conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are property‑specific, contractually defined and
vary significantly from property to property. work programs are designed to
ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. in some instances, the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. in cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. the scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation.

d. summary of acreage terms

united states 

oil and gas exploration and production
rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease. mineral
interest owners include the federal and state governments, as well as private
mineral interest owners. leases typically have an exploration period ranging
from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect
until production ceases. under certain circumstances, a lease may be held
beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. in some
instances regarding private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the
underlying mineral interests are owned outright.

canada / other
americas 

canada 

exploration licenses or leases in onshore
areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions
possible. these licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing
licenses or leases upon completing specified work. in general, these license
and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability
on the licenses and leases. exploration licenses in offshore eastern canada and
the beaufort sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals.
they are valid for a maximum term of nine years. offshore production licenses
are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production.
significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently
undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term. 

argentina 

the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in
december 2014. the onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are
up to six years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an
optional extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the
area. pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional
production concession would be 25 years, and 35 years for an unconventional concession,
with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. 

guyana 

the petroleum (exploration and production)
act authorizes the government of guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and
production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration
and production of hydrocarbons. petroleum agreements provide for an exploration
period of up to 10 years with a production period of 20 years with a 10 year
extension. 

europe 

germany 

exploration concessions are granted for an
initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of
up to three years each. extensions are subject to specific, minimum work
commitments. production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with
multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.

netherlands                                                                      

under the mining law, effective january 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. the term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
mining law. 

production rights granted prior to january 1, 2003, remain
subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore
areas. onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from
1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license,
ranging from 35 to 45 years. offshore production licenses issued before 1976
were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued
for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.


norway 

licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial
period of up to six years (with extension of the initial period of one year at
a time up to ten years after 1985), and an extension period of up to 30 years,
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the
end of the initial period. licenses issued after july 1, 1997, have an initial
period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in
special cases of up to 50 years, and with relinquishment of at least one-half
of the original area required at the end of the initial period.

united
kingdom 

acreage terms are fixed by the government
and are periodically changed. for example, many of the early licenses issued
under the first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. at the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. the majority of traditional licenses currently issued have
an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four
years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment
of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is
not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term. 

terms for exploration acreage in technically
challenged areas are governed by frontier production licenses, generally
covering a larger initial area than traditional licenses, with an initial
exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six
years, and a final production term of 18 years, with relinquishment of 75
percent of the original area after three years and 50 percent of the remaining
acreage after the next three years. innovate licenses issued replace
traditional and frontier licenses and offer greater flexibility with respect to
periods and work program commitments.

africa 

angola 

exploration and production activities are
governed by production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of
four years and an optional second phase of two to three years. the production
period is 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated
extension. 

chad 

exploration permits are issued for a period of five years,
and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. the terms and
conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified
in a negotiated convention. the production term is 30 years and in 2017 was
extended by 20 years to 2050. 

equatorial guinea 

exploration, development and production activities are
governed by production sharing contracts (pscs) negotiated with the state
ministry of mines and hydrocarbons. a new psc was ratified in 2018; the initial
exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year extensions
available at the discretion of the ministry and limited relinquishments in the
absence of commercial discoveries. the production period for crude oil ranges
from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25
to 50 years. 

mozambique 

exploration and production activities are generally
governed by concession contracts with the government of the republic of
mozambique, represented by the ministry of mineral resources and energy. an
interest in area 4 offshore mozambique was acquired in 2017. terms for area 4
are governed by the exploration and production concession contract (epcc) for
area 4 offshore of the rovuma block. the epcc expires 30 years after the approval
of a plan of development for a given discovery area. 

in 2018 an interest was acquired in offshore blocks, a5-b,
z5-c and z5-d. terms for the three blocks are governed by their respective
epccs, which have an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 with the
possibility of two additional exploration phases expiring in 2024 and 2025. the
epccs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after
the approval of a plan of development. 

nigeria 

exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (pscs)
with the national oil company, the nigerian national petroleum corporation
(nnpc). nnpc typically holds the underlying oil prospecting license (opl) and
any resulting oil mining lease (oml). the terms of the pscs are generally 30
years, including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase
that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an opl. upon
commercial discovery, an opl may be converted to an oml. partial relinquishment
is required under the psc at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and
omls have a 20-year production period that may be extended. 

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by
joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl. opls in
deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years, while in all other areas the
licenses are for five years. demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis
for conversion of an opl to an oml. 


 

 





21 








 



omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum
act (i.e., under the mineral oils act 1914, repealed by the 1969 petroleum act)
were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed,
effective december 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further
renewal option of 20 years. operations under these pre-1969 omls are conducted
under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc. commercial terms
applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the petroleum
profits tax act. 

omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act, which include
all deepwater omls, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for
onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months’ written notice,
for another period of 20 years. omls not held by nnpc are also subject to a
mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration.


asia 

azerbaijan 

the production sharing agreement (psa) for
the development of the azeri-chirag-gunashli field was established for an
initial period of 30 years starting from the psa execution date in 1994. the
psa was amended in september 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.

other exploration and production
activities are governed by psas negotiated with the national oil company of
azerbaijan. the exploration period typically consists of three or four years
with the possibility of a one to three-year extension. the production period,
which includes development, is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of
one or two five-year extensions. 

indonesia 

exploration and production activities in
indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form
of a production sharing contract (psc), negotiated with bpmigas, a government
agency established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. in 2012,
indonesia’s constitutional court ruled certain articles of law relating to
bpmigas to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing pscs signed with
bpmigas should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties
previously performed by bpmigas are to be carried out by the relevant ministry
of the government of indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law.
by presidential decree, skkmigas became the interim successor to bpmigas. the
current pscs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up
to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. pscs generally require the
contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after
three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50
percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending
on the acreage and terms. 

iraq 

development and production activities in
the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil
companies of the iraqi ministry of oil. an exxonmobil affiliate entered into a
contract with basra oil company of the iraqi ministry of oil for the rights to
participate in the development and production activities of the west qurna
phase i oil and gas field effective march 1, 2010. the term of the contract is
20 years with the right to extend for five years. the contract provides for
cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified
levels. 

exploration and production activities in
the kurdistan region of iraq are governed by production sharing contracts
(pscs) negotiated with the regional government of kurdistan in 2011. the
exploration term is for five years, with extensions available as provided by
the pscs and at the discretion of the regional government of kurdistan. current
pscs remain in effect by agreement of the regional government to allow additional
time for exploration or evaluation of commerciality. the production period is
20 years with the right to extend for five years.

kazakhstan 

onshore exploration and production
activities are governed by the production license, exploration license and
joint venture agreements negotiated with the republic of kazakhstan. existing
production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993. 

offshore exploration and production
activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the
republic of kazakhstan. the exploration period is six years followed by
separate appraisal periods for each discovery. the production period for each
discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration
of commerciality with the possibility of two ten-year extensions. 

malaysia 

production activities are governed by production sharing
contracts (pscs) negotiated with the national oil company. the pscs have
exploration and production terms ranging up to 38 years. all extensions are
subject to the national oil company’s prior written approval. the production
periods range from 15 to 29 years, depending on the provisions of the
respective contract.

qatar 

the state of qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore north field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and lng sales obligations of these projects. 

russia 

terms for exxonmobil’s sakhalin acreage are fixed by the
current production sharing agreement (psa) between the russian government and
the sakhalin-1 consortium, of which exxonmobil is the operator. 

exxonmobil withdrew from the joint ventures with rosneft
for the kara, laptev, chukchi and black seas, effective april 30, 2018.
exxonmobil continues to remain in compliance with all laws applicable to its
operations and investments in the russian federation.

thailand 

the petroleum act of 1971 allows production under
exxonmobil’s concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time. the term of the concession expires in 2021.

united arab emirates 

an interest in the development and production activities of
the upper zakum field, a major offshore field, was acquired in 2006. in 2017
the governing agreements were extended to 2051.

australia / oceania 

australia 

exploration and production activities conducted offshore in
commonwealth waters are governed by federal legislation. exploration permits
are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year
renewal periods. retention leases may be granted for resources that are not
commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become
commercially viable within 15 years. these are granted for periods of five
years and renewals may be requested. prior to july 1998, production licenses
were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter “indefinitely”, i.e., for the life of the field. effective from july
1998, new production licenses are granted “indefinitely”. in each case, a
production license may be terminated if no production operations have been
carried on for five years.

papua new guinea 

exploration and production activities are governed by the
oil and gas act. petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term
of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of
three years is possible in certain circumstances). generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial
six-year term, if extended. petroleum development licenses are granted for an
initial 25-year period. an extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the
minister’s discretion. petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas
resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may
become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15
years. petroleum retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be
extended, at the minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of
15 years. extensions of petroleum retention licenses may be for periods of less
than one year, renewable annually, if the minister considers at the time of
extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five
years.

(1)   capacity data is based on
100 percent of rated refinery process unit stream-day capacities under
normal operating conditions, less the impact of shutdowns for regular repair
and maintenance activities, averaged over an extended period of time. the
listing excludes refining capacity for a minor interest held through equity
securities in new zealand, and the laffan refinery in qatar for which results
are reported in the upstream segment.

(2)   thousands of barrels per day (kbd).
exxonmobil share reflects 100 percent of atmospheric distillation capacity
in operations of exxonmobil and majority-owned subsidiaries. for companies
owned 50 percent or less, exxonmobil share is the greater of exxonmobil’s
interest or that portion of distillation capacity normally available to
exxonmobil.

proceedings

in
a matter reported in the corporation’s form 10-q for the second quarter of
2018, the state of ohio department of natural resources, division of oil &
gas resources management (odnr) and xto energy inc. (xto) signed a compliance
agreement on december 21, 2018, regarding alleged violations by xto of the ohio
revised code, ohio administrative code, and implementing regulations arising
out of the schnegg well incident in belmont county, ohio, in early 2018. the
compliance agreement settles the following alleged actions of xto: (1) causing
brine to be discharged and contact the ground and/or surface water; (2) failure
to place cement in the casing string per ohio codes; (3) allowing a well to
flow gas uncontrolled; (4) failure to construct, drill and operate a well in
the manner as permitted and planned; and (5) failure to notify the odnr upon
discovery a well had sustained annular pressure above the prescribed pressure.
the penalty assessment was $850,000, half paid to the odnr on january 15, 2019,
and half to be paid to 29 agencies located in belmont county as designated by
the odnr. 

in
another matter relating to the schnegg well incident, reported in the
corporation’s form 10-q for the second quarter of 2018, the state of ohio
environmental protection agency (oepa) and xto signed final findings and orders
on december 28, 2018, regarding oepa allegations that xto violated the ohio
revised code and implementing regulations, including but not limited to: (1)
failure to maintain and operate its facility in a manner using good pollution
control practices; (2) failure to provide a malfunction report; (3) failure to
complete and properly report quarterly inspections; and (4) failure to submit
site-specific work practice plans within applicable time limits. the penalty
assessment of $150,000 was paid on january 21, 2019, half to the oepa and half
to a supplemental environmental project.

as
reported in the corporation’s form 10-q for the first quarter of 2018, the
corporation received a proposed agreed order from the texas commission on
environmental quality (tceq), dated march 15, 2018, related to routine title v
air operating permit investigations conducted by the tceq in 2017 of the
baytown refinery in texas. the proposed agreed order alleged that the refinery
failed to authorize, monitor, or keep records on certain equipment and to
comply with certain flare or fuel gas monitoring system availability requirements
or concentration limits. after receipt of additional information from
exxonmobil and further evaluation of the alleged violations, the tceq has
issued a revised proposed agreed order, reducing the number of alleged
violations and agreeing to an administrative penalty of $56,596 in settlement
of these matters. the agreed order was signed by exxonmobil on december 18,
2018, and exxonmobil paid $28,298 on january 10, 2019. the balance will be paid
to a supplemental environmental project upon endorsement by the tceq.

as
last reported in the corporation’s form 10-q for the third quarter of 2018, on
july 20, 2017, the united states department of treasury, office of foreign
assets control (ofac) assessed a civil penalty against exxon mobil corporation,
exxonmobil development company and exxonmobil oil corporation for violating the
ukraine-related sanctions regulations, 31 c.f.r. part 589. the assessed civil
penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. exxonmobil and its affiliates have been
and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any
violation has occurred. exxonmobil and its affiliates filed a complaint on july 20,
2017, in the united states federal district court, northern district of texas
seeking judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the
administrative procedures act and the united states constitution, including on
the basis that it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by ofac and a
violation of the company’s due process rights.

as indicated in the certifications in exhibit 31 of this

and principal accounting officer have evaluated the corporation’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of december 31, 2018. based on that

officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the

effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on
this evaluation, management concluded that exxon mobil corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2018.

frequently used terms 

 



listed below are definitions of several of exxonmobil’s key
business and financial performance measures. these definitions are provided to
facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. 

cash flow from operations and asset sales 

cash
flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
consolidated statement of cash flows. this cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the corporation’s assets and from the divesting of
assets. the corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporation’s
strategic objectives. assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

capital employed 

capital
employed is a measure of net investment. when viewed from the perspective of
how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes exxonmobil’s net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. when viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the corporation, it includes
exxonmobil’s share of total debt and equity. both of these views include
exxonmobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

frequently used terms 

 



return on average capital employed 

return
on average capital employed (roce) is a performance measure ratio. from the
perspective of the business segments, roce is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). these segment earnings include exxonmobil’s share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. the corporation’s total roce is
net income attributable to exxonmobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. the corporation
has consistently applied its roce definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to
demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long
term. additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make
investment decisions.

and taxation; project plans, capacities, schedules and costs; production growth
and mix; rates of field decline; asset carrying values; proved reserves;
financing sources; the resolution of contingencies and uncertain tax positions;
and environmental and capital expenditures; could differ materially depending
on a number of factors, such as changes in the supply of and demand for crude
oil, natural gas, and petroleum and petrochemical products and resulting price
impacts; the outcome of commercial negotiations; the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms; political or regulatory events; the outcome of exploration
and development projects; technological developments; and other factors
discussed herein and in item 1a. risk factors.

overview 

the
following discussion and analysis of exxonmobil’s financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of exxon mobil corporation. the corporation’s accounting and financial
reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration
for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport
and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a
wide variety of specialty products. 

exxonmobil,
with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and
technology portfolio, is well‑positioned to participate in substantial
investments to develop new energy supplies. the company’s integrated business
model, with significant investments in upstream, downstream and chemical
segments, reduces the corporation’s risk from changes in commodity prices. while
commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a
short-term basis, exxonmobil’s investment decisions are grounded on
fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined
approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment
opportunities. the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process
that is the basis for setting near-term operating and capital objectives in
addition to providing the longer-term economic assumptions used for investment
evaluation purposes. volumes are based on individual field production profiles,
which are also updated annually. price ranges for crude oil, natural gas,
refined products, and chemical products are based on corporate plan assumptions
developed annually by major region and are utilized for investment evaluation
purposes. major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential
market conditions. once major investments are made, a reappraisal process is
completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are
incorporated into future projects.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



business environment and risk assessment 

long-term business outlook 

the
long-term business outlook is based on the corporation’s 2018 outlook for
energy, which is used to help inform our long term business strategies and
investment plans. by 2040, the world’s population is projected at around 9.2
billion people, or about 1.7 billion more than in 2016. coincident with this
population increase, the corporation expects worldwide economic growth to
average close to 3 percent per year, with economic output nearly doubling by
2040. as economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for
billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. even
with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by
about 25 percent from 2016 to 2040. this increase in energy demand is expected
to be driven by developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations
of the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd)).

as
expanding prosperity helps drive global energy demand higher, increasing use of
energy efficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission fuels
will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per
unit of economic output over time. substantial efficiency gains are likely in
all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting energy
requirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and
residential and commercial needs.

global
electricity demand is expected to increase approximately 60 percent from 2016
to 2040, with developing countries likely to account for about 85 percent of
the increase. consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to
remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy
demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources. the share of coal fired
generation is likely to decline substantially and approach 25 percent of the
world’s electricity in 2040, versus nearly 40 percent in 2016, in part as a
result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions
to address the risks of climate change. from 2016 to 2040, the amount of
electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is likely
to nearly double, and account for about 95 percent of the growth in electricity
supplies. electricity from wind and solar is likely to increase about 400
percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g. hydropower) to
account for about half of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide
through 2040. total renewables will likely reach nearly 35 percent of global
electricity supplies by 2040. natural gas and nuclear are also expected to
increase shares over the period to 2040, reaching about 25 percent and 12
percent of global electricity supplies respectively by 2040. supplies of electricity
by energy type will reflect significant differences across regions reflecting a
wide range of factors including the cost and availability of various energy
supplies.

energy
for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes – is
expected to increase approximately 30 percent from 2016 to 2040. transportation
energy demand is likely to account for approximately 60 percent of the growth
in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. liquid fuels demand for
light-duty vehicles is expected to remain relatively flat to 2040 as the impact
of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by china,
europe, and the united states, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet
of about 75 percent. by 2040, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for
about 20 percent of global liquid fuels demand. during the same time period, nearly
all the world’s transportation fleets are likely to continue to run on liquid
fuels, which are widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a
large quantity of energy in small volumes.

liquid
fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting
broad-based availability, affordability, ease of transportation, and fitness as
a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. by 2040, global demand
for liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 118 million barrels of
oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 20 percent from 2016. the non-oecd
share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to about 65 percent
by 2040, as liquid fuels demand in the oecd is likely to decline by close to 10
percent. much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude
production from traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain
important and significant development activity is expected to offset much of
the natural declines from these fields. at the same time, a variety of emerging
supply sources – including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids
and biofuels – are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. the world’s
resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2040 as technology
advances continue to expand the availability of economic supply options.
however, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with
reliable and affordable supplies.

natural
gas is a versatile and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications, and
it is expected to grow the most of any primary energy type from 2016 to 2040,
meeting more than 35 percent of global energy demand growth. global natural gas
demand is expected to rise nearly 40 percent from 2016 to 2040, with about 45
percent of that increase in the asia pacific region. significant growth in supplies
of unconventional gas – the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock
formations – will help meet these needs. in total, about 55 percent of the
growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources.
at the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the
cornerstone of global supply, meeting about two-thirds of worldwide demand in
2040. liquefied natural gas (lng) trade will expand significantly, meeting
about one-third of the increase in global demand growth, with much of this
supply expected to help meet rising demand in asia pacific.

the world’s energy mix is highly diverse
and will remain so through 2040. oil is expected to remain the largest source
of energy with its share remaining close to one third in 2040. coal is
currently the second largest source of energy, but it is likely to lose that
position to natural gas in the 2020-2025 timeframe. the share of natural gas is
expected to reach 25 percent by 2040, while the share of coal falls to about 20
percent. nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are
likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well
as energy security and environmental issues. total renewable energy is likely
to exceed 15 percent of global energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and
geothermal contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent. total energy
supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing
nearly 250 percent from 2016 to 2040, when they will likely be about 5 percent
of the world energy mix.

the
corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base
will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from increases in previously
discovered fields. technology will underpin these increases. the investments to
develop and supply resources to meet global demand through 2040 will be
significant – even if demand remains flat. this reflects a fundamental aspect
of the oil and natural gas business, in that, as the international energy
agency (iea) notes in its world energy outlook 2018, a “key underlying
driver for new investment is declining output from existing fields.” according
to the iea’s new policies scenario, the investment required to meet oil and
natural gas supply requirements worldwide over the period 2018-2040 will be
about $21 trillion (measured in 2017 dollars) or approximately $900 billion per
year on average.

international
accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse
gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it
difficult to predict their business impact. for many years, the corporation has
taken into account policies established to reduce energy related greenhouse gas
emissions in its long-term outlook for energy. the climate accord
reached at the conference of the parties (cop 21) in paris set many new goals,
and many related policies are still emerging. our outlook  reflects an
environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with
the aggregation of nationally determined contributions which were submitted by
signatories to the united nations framework convention on climate change
(unfccc) 2015 paris agreement. our outlook  seeks to identify potential
impacts of climate related policies, which often target specific sectors. it
estimates potential impacts of these policies on consumer energy demand by
using various assumptions and tools – including, depending on the sector, application
of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies (e.g. automotive
fuel economy standards). for purposes of the outlook, a proxy cost on
energy-related co2 emissions is assumed to reach about $80 per tonne
on average in 2040 in oecd nations. china and other leading non-oecd nations
are expected to trail oecd policy initiatives. nevertheless, as people and
nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will
continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability
or reliability of the energy they need. 

practical
solutions to the world’s energy and climate challenges will benefit from market
competition as well as well informed, well designed, and transparent policy
approaches that carefully weigh costs and benefits. such policies are likely to
help manage the risks of climate change while also enabling societies to pursue
other high priority goals around the world – including clean air and water,
access to reliable, affordable energy, and economic progress for all people.
all practical and economically-viable energy sources, both conventional and
unconventional, will need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy
demand, recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide energy needs as well as
the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standards
of living for billions of people. 

the
information provided in the long-term business outlook includes exxonmobil’s
internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and analyses as well
as publicly available information from external sources including the
international energy agency.

 

upstream 

exxonmobil
continues to sustain a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development
opportunities, which enables the corporation to be selective, maximizing
shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. exxonmobil’s
fundamental strategies guide our global upstream business, including capturing
material and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade the resource
portfolio, selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resources,
developing and applying high-impact technologies, and pursuing productivity and
efficiency gains. these strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on
operational excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the
communities within which we operate. 

as
future development projects and drilling activities bring new production
online, the corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type
of opportunities from which volumes are produced. based on current investment
plans, oil-equivalent production from the americas is expected to increase to
be a majority of total production over the next several years. further, the
proportion of our global production from unconventional, deepwater, and lng
resource types, currently contributes over a third of global production, and is
expected to grow to be more than half in the next few years.

management’s discussion and analysis of

the corporation anticipates several
projects will come online over the next few years providing additional
production capacity. however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to
the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir
performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes;
the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price
effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of
capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price
environment; and other factors described in item 1a. risk factors.

the
markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price
volatility. exxonmobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be
driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a
function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology
advances, consumer preference and government policies. on the supply side,
prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of opec
and other large government resource owners, and other factors. to manage the
risks associated with price, exxonmobil evaluates annual plans and major
investments across a range of price scenarios. 

in
2018, the upstream business produced 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day.
during the year, the corporation added 4.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved
reserves. the corporation continued to have exploration success in guyana and
also made strategic acreage acquisitions in mozambique, brazil, papua new
guinea and u.s. tight oil.

 

downstream 

exxonmobil’s
downstream is a large, diversified business with global logistics, trading,
refining, and marketing. the corporation has a presence with established
markets in the americas and europe, as well as in the growing asia pacific
region.

exxonmobil’s
fundamental downstream business strategies competitively position the company
across a range of market conditions. these strategies include targeting best in
class operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced
technologies, capitalizing on integration across exxonmobil businesses,
selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently
and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and
services to customers. 

exxonmobil’s
operating results, as noted in item 2. properties, reflect 21 refineries,
located in 14 countries, with distillation capacity of 4.7 million barrels per
day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 128 thousand barrels per
day. exxonmobil’s fuels and lubes value chains have significant global reach,
with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base. our portfolio
of world-renowned brands includes exxon, mobil, esso, synergy, and mobil
1.  

demand
for products continued to grow in 2018. north america’s margins strengthened
and refineries within the region also benefitted from crude differentials
associated with the permian basin and western canada. margins in europe and
asia weakened under pressure from lower cost production from north america and
increased product exports from china. in the near term, we see variability in
refining margins as new capacity additions are expected to outpace capacity
rationalization and growth in global demand, which can also be affected by
global economic conditions and regulatory changes.

refining
margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a
function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials
(primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced
(primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil). crude oil
and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those
quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., new york mercantile
exchange and intercontinental exchange). prices for these commodities are
determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors,
including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels,
industry refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal
demand, weather, and political climate. 

exxonmobil’s
long term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain volatile subject
to the pace of new capacity growth relative to global demand growth.
exxonmobil’s integration including logistics, trading, refining, and marketing
enhances our ability to generate returns across the value chain in both fuels
and lubricants businesses.

as
described in more detail in item 1a. risk factors, proposed carbon policy and
other climate related regulations in many countries, as well as the continued
growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the downstream
business.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



exxonmobil continued to progress the
multi-year transition of the direct served (i.e., dealer, company operated)
retail network in portions of europe to a more capital efficient branded
wholesaler model. the lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging world
class brands and integration with industry leading basestock refining
capability. through the mobil branded properties, such as mobil 1, mobil
is the worldwide leader among synthetic motors oils. 

the
downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of the business
cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade. when
investing in the downstream, exxonmobil remains focused on selective and
resilient projects. at the end of 2018, three key projects are in operation
with the new delayed coker unit at the refinery in antwerp, belgium, to upgrade
low value bunker fuel into higher value diesel products, and the proprietary
hydrocracker at the refinery in rotterdam, netherlands, to produce higher value
ultra-low sulfur diesel and group ii basestocks. finally, the new hydrofiner at
the beaumont, texas, refinery was completed, which increases production of
ultra-low sulfur fuels by approximately 40,000 barrels per day.

 

chemical 

exxonmobil
is a major manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals and a wide variety of
specialty products. exxonmobil sustains its competitive advantage through
continued operational excellence, investment and cost discipline, a balanced
portfolio of products, and integration with downstream and upstream operations,
all underpinned by proprietary technology.

demand
for products continued to grow in 2018. polyolefin and specialty product
margins weakened with capacity additions outpacing global demand growth. 

over
the long term, demand for chemical products is forecast to outpace growth in
global gdp and energy demand for the next two decades. exxonmobil estimates
that global demand for chemicals will rise by approximately 45 percent over the
next decade. exxonmobil’s integration with refining enhances our ability to
generate returns across the value chain in chemical businesses.

in
2018, we completed start-up of the new world-scale ethane cracker in baytown,
texas, the specialty elastomer plant expansion in newport, wales, and the new
halobutyl rubber unit in singapore to further extend our specialty product
capacity. construction continues on the expansion of the polyethylene plant in
beaumont, texas, with startup anticipated in 2019, to capitalize on advantaged
feedstock and energy supplies in north america and to meet rapidly growing
demand for performance polymers. work continues to integrate the singapore
banyan aromatics unit, acquired in 2017, with our other singapore facilities to
meet growing demand for chemicals products in asia pacific. in addition,
exxonmobil announced plans for a flexible-feed cracker in guangdong province,
china, and a joint venture ethane cracker and associated products with sabic to
be located in san patricio county, texas.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.

 

entitlements - net interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of
production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume‑determining
factors. these factors consist of net interest changes specified in production
sharing contracts (pscs) which typically occur when cumulative investment
returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity
upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity
redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the
termination or expiry of a concession. once a net interest change has occurred,
it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil
prices.

 

entitlements - price, spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of
production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational
volume-determining factors. these factors include changes in oil and gas prices
or spending levels from one period to another. according to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to exxonmobil. for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for exxonmobil to recover its costs. these effects generally vary from
period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and
natural gas. such factors can also include other temporary changes in net
interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.

 

quotas are changes in exxonmobil’s allowable production arising
from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the
organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec). volumes reported in
this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.

 

divestments are reductions in exxonmobil’s production
arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a
field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. 

 

growth and other factors comprise all other operational
and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may
affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but are not
limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities,
acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand,
natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect
entitlements.

2018 

chemical earnings of $3,351 million
decreased $1,167 million from 2017. 

·        
weaker margins
decreased earnings by $910 million. 

·        
volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $280 million, primarily due to sales growth. 

·        
all other items
decreased earnings by $540 million, primarily due to the absence of
favorable impacts from u.s. tax reform of $335 million, higher downtime/maintenance,
and growth-related expenses, partly offset by a favorable tax item and
favorable foreign exchange impacts. 

·        
u.s. chemical earnings
were $1,642 million in 2018, compared with $2,190 million in the prior
year which included $335 million in favorable impacts from u.s. tax reform.

·        
non‑u.s.
chemical earnings were $1,709 million, compared with $2,328 million in the
prior year.

·

·        
weaker margins
decreased earnings by $260 million. 

·        
volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $100 million. 

·        
all other items
increased earnings by $60 million, primarily due to u.s. tax reform of
$335 million and improved inventory effects, partially offset by higher
expenses from increased turnaround activity and new business growth. 

·        
u.s. chemical earnings
were $2,190 million in 2017, including favorable u.s. tax reform impacts
of $335 million. 

·

2018 

corporate and financing expenses were
$2,600 million in 2018 compared to $3,760 million in 2017, with the
decrease mainly due to absence of prior year unfavorable impacts of $2.1
billion from u.s. tax reform, partly offset by higher pension and financing
related costs, lower u.s. tax rate, and lower net favorable tax items.

 

2017 

corporate
and financing expenses were $3,760 million in 2017 compared to
$1,172 million in 2016, with the increase mainly due to unfavorable
impacts of $2.1 billion from u.s. tax reform and the absence of favorable
non-u.s. tax items.

total
cash and cash equivalents were $3.0 billion at the end of 2018, down $0.1
billion from the prior year. the major sources of funds in 2018 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $21.4 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $18.7 billion for depreciation and depletion, and
proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion. the major uses of funds included
spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $19.6 billion,
dividends to shareholders of $13.8 billion, net debt repayments of $4.9
billion, an increase in inventories of $3.1 billion, the adjustment for net
gains on asset sales of $2.0 billion, and additional investments and advances
of $2.0 billion. 

total
cash and cash equivalents were $3.2 billion at the end of 2017, down $0.5
billion from the prior year. the major sources of funds in 2017 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $19.8 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $19.9 billion for depreciation and depletion,
proceeds from asset sales of $3.1 billion, and other investing activities
including collection of advances of $2.1 billion. the major uses of funds
included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $15.4 billion,
dividends to shareholders of $13.0 billion, the adjustment for noncash deferred
income tax credits of $8.6 billion, and additional investments and advances of
$5.5 billion. 

the
corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term
liquidity. internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required. on
december 31, 2018, the corporation had unused committed short-term lines of
credit of $5.3 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit of
$0.2 billion. cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the
corporation’s immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality
and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet
the corporation’s cash requirements, and to optimize returns. 

to
support cash flows in future periods the corporation will need to continually
find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new
technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or
increase production. after a period of production at plateau rates, it is the
nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the
remainder of their economic life. averaged over all the corporation’s existing
oil and gas fields and without new projects and growth in key tight-oil plays,
exxonmobil’s production is expected to decline at an average of approximately 3
percent per year over the next few years. decline rates can vary widely by
individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the
type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and
age of the field. furthermore, the corporation’s net interest in production for
individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial
terms. 

the
corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of natural field
decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project
execution. the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over
the next few years providing additional production capacity. however, actual
volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project
start‑ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of
enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production
sharing contracts; and changes in the amount and timing of investments that may
vary depending on the oil and gas price environment. the corporation’s cash
flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. please
refer to item 1a. risk factors for a more complete discussion of risks. 

the
corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital
expenditures. capital and exploration expenditures in 2018 were $25.9 billion,
reflecting the corporation’s continued active investment program. the
corporation anticipates an investment level of approximately $30 billion in
2019.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. the corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of
development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the
overall political and technical risks of the corporation’s upstream segment and
associated cash flow. further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and
diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay
of any single project would not have a significant impact on the corporation’s
liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its
fixed commitments.

 

exxonmobil closely monitors the potential
impacts of brexit and libor reform under a number of scenarios and has taken
steps to mitigate their potential impact. accordingly, exxonmobil does not
believe these events represent a material risk to the corporation’s
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

 

cash flow from
operating activities

 

2018 

cash provided by operating activities
totaled $36.0 billion in 2018, $5.9 billion higher than 2017. the major source
of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $21.4 billion, an
increase of $1.6 billion. the noncash provision for depreciation and depletion
was $18.7 billion, down $1.1 billion from the prior year. the adjustment for
the net gain on asset sales was $2.0 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. the adjustment
for dividends received less than equity in current earnings of equity companies
was a reduction of $1.7 billion, compared to an increase of $0.1 billion in
2017. the adjustment for deferred income tax credits was $0.1 billion, compared
to $8.6 billion in 2017. changes in operational working capital, excluding cash
and debt, decreased cash in 2018 by $1.4 billion.

 

2017 

cash provided by operating activities
totaled $30.1 billion in 2017, $8.0 billion higher than 2016. the major source

increase of $11.5 billion. the noncash provision for depreciation and depletion
was $19.9 billion, down $2.4 billion from the prior year. the adjustment for
deferred income tax credits was $8.6 billion, compared to $4.4 billion in 2016.
changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash
in 2017 by $0.6 billion.

  

cash flow from
investing activities

 

2018

cash used in
investing activities netted to $16.4 billion in 2018, $0.7 billion higher than
2017. spending for property, plant and equipment of $19.6 billion increased
$4.2 billion from 2017. proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property,
plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments of $4.1 billion
compared to $3.1 billion in 2017. additional investments and advances were $3.5
billion lower in 2018, while proceeds from other investing activities including

financial condition and results of operations

 



cash flow from financing activities 

 

2018 

cash
used in financing activities was $19.4 billion in 2018, $4.3 billion higher
than 2017. dividend payments on common shares increased to $3.23 per share from
$3.06 per share and totaled $13.8 billion. total debt decreased $4.5 billion to
$37.8 billion at year‑end. the reduction was principally driven by net
short-term debt and commercial paper repayments of $5.0 billion.

exxonmobil
share of equity increased $4.1 billion to $191.8 billion. the addition to
equity for earnings was $20.8 billion. this was partly offset by reductions for
distributions to exxonmobil shareholders of $13.8 billion, all in the form of
dividends. foreign exchange translation effects of $4.4 billion for the stronger
u.s. currency reduced equity, while a $1.1 billion change in the funded status
of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity. 

during 2018, exxon mobil corporation acquired
8 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. purchases were made to offset
shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s
benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,239 million to
4,237 million at the end of 2018.

 

2017 

cash
used in financing activities was $15.1 billion in 2017, $5.8 billion higher
than 2016. dividend payments on common shares increased to $3.06 per share from
$2.98 per share and totaled $13.0 billion. total debt decreased $0.4 billion to
$42.3 billion at year‑end. the reduction was principally driven by net
repayments of $1.0 billion, and included short-term debt repayments of $5.0
billion that were partly offset by additions in commercial paper and other debt
of $4.0 billion.

exxonmobil
share of equity increased $20.4 billion to $187.7 billion. the addition to
equity for earnings was $19.7 billion. this was partly offset by reductions for
distributions to exxonmobil shareholders of $13.0 billion, all in the form of
dividends. foreign exchange translation effects of $5.0 billion for the weaker
u.s. currency and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of the
postretirement benefits reserves both increased equity. shares issued for
acquisitions added $7.8 billion to equity. 

during 2017, exxon mobil corporation acquired
10 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. purchases were made to offset
shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s
benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased from 4,148 million to
4,239 million at the end of 2017, mainly due to a total of 96 million shares
issued for the acquisitions of interoil corporation and of companies that hold
acreage in the permian basin.

this
table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no
fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an
active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts
with similar pricing terms. examples include long-term, noncancelable lng and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. the
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $9.2 billion as of
december 31, 2018, because the corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in “note
19: income and other taxes”.

notes: 

(1)   includes capitalized lease
obligations of $1,303 million. 

(2)   the amount due in one year is
included in notes and loans payable of $17,258 million. 

(3)   asset retirement obligations are
primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of field life. 

(4)   the amount by which the benefit
obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain u.s. and
non-u.s. pension and other postretirement plans at year-end. the payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2019 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years. 

(5)   minimum commitments for operating
leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers and
other assets. total includes $623 million related to drilling rigs and related
equipment.

(6)   take-or-pay obligations are
noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. unconditional
purchase obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or
cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to
secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. the undiscounted obligations of $30,715 million mainly pertain to
pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements. 

(7)   firm capital commitments represent
legally binding payment obligations to third parties where agreements
specifying all significant terms have been executed for the construction and
purchase of fixed assets and other permanent investments. in certain cases
where the corporation executes contracts requiring commitments to a work scope,
those commitments have been included to the extent that the amounts and timing
of payments can be reliably estimated. firm capital commitments, shown on an
undiscounted basis, totaled $11.6 billion, including $2.5 billion in the u.s.

firm capital commitments for the non-u.s. upstream
of $8.6 billion were primarily associated with projects in guyana, africa, united
kingdom, united arab emirates, malaysia, australia, canada and norway. the
corporation expects to fund the majority of these commitments with internally
generated funds, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



guarantees 

the corporation and certain of its consolidated
subsidiaries were contingently liable at december 31, 2018, for guarantees
relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts (note 16). where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. these guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources. 

 

financial strength 

on december 31, 2018, the
corporation’s unused short-term committed lines of credit totaled $5.3 billion
(note 6) and unused long-term committed lines of credit totaled $0.2 billion
(note 14). the table below shows the corporation’s consolidated
debt-to-capital ratios. the data demonstrates the corporation’s
creditworthiness.

management views the corporation’s
financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial ratios and other
similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. the
corporation’s sound financial position gives it the opportunity to access the
world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions, and enables the
corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of
maximizing shareholder value. 

 

litigation and other contingencies 

as
discussed in note 16, a variety of claims have been made against exxonmobil and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. based
on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation
does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
exxonmobil will have a material adverse effect upon the corporation’s
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
there are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. refer to note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

capital
and exploration expenditures in 2018 were $25.9 billion, as the corporation
continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. the corporation anticipates an investment
level of approximately $30 billion in 2019. actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.

upstream
spending of $20.2 billion in 2018 was up 21 percent from 2017. investments in
2018 included growth in the u.s. permian basin, acreage acquisitions in brazil
and global development projects. development projects typically take several
years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of
production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. the
percentage of proved developed reserves was 68 percent of total proved reserves
at year‑end 2018, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.

capital
investments in the downstream totaled $3.4 billion in 2018, an increase of $0.9
billion from 2017, reflecting global project spending and a lubricants
acquisition in indonesia. chemical capital expenditures of $2.2 billion,
decreased $1.5 billion, representing investments in growth projects offset by
the 2017 acquisition of a large-scale aromatics plant in singapore.

2018 

total taxes on the corporation’s income
statement were $44.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $13.5 billion from 2017.
income tax expense, both current and deferred, was $9.5 billion compared to a
credit of $1.2 billion in 2017. the effective tax rate, which is calculated
based on consolidated company income taxes and exxonmobil’s share of equity
company income taxes, was 37 percent compared to 5 percent. the increase
principally reflects the absence of the impact of u.s. tax reform in the prior
year. total other taxes and duties of $35.2 billion in 2018 increased $2.8
billion.

 

2017 

total taxes on the corporation’s income
statement were $31.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $0.3 billion from 2016.
income tax expense, both current and deferred, was a credit of $1.2 billion
compared to a credit of $0.4 billion in 2016, with the u.s. tax reform impact
of $5.9 billion partially offset by higher pre-tax income. the effective tax
rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and
exxonmobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 5 percent compared to 13
percent in the prior year due primarily to the impact of u.s. tax reform. total
other taxes and duties of $32.5 billion in 2017 increased $1.1 billion.

 

u.s.
tax reform

following the december 22, 2017, enactment
of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act, in accordance with accounting standard
codification topic 740 (income taxes) and following the guidance outlined in
the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118, the corporation included a $5,942
million credit in its 2017 results, representing a reasonable estimate of the
income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate. the corporation’s
results for 2018 include a $291 million tax credit, mainly in the non-u.s.
upstream, reflecting an updated estimate of the impact of u.s. tax reform
including clarifications provided in proposed transition tax regulations issued
by the u.s. treasury in 2018. the corporation has completed its accounting for
the enactment-date income tax effects of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act in
accordance with accounting standard codification topic 740 (income taxes).

throughout
exxonmobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. these
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. using definitions and guidelines established by
the american petroleum institute, exxonmobil’s 2018 worldwide environmental
expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including
exxonmobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $4.9 billion, of
which $3.6 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. the total cost for such activities is expected to increase to
approximately $5.7 billion in 2019 and 2020. capital expenditures are
expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total.

environmental liabilities 

the corporation accrues environmental
liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the
amounts can be reasonably estimated. this policy applies to assets or
businesses currently owned or previously disposed. exxonmobil has accrued
liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various
sites, including multiparty sites where the u.s. environmental protection
agency has identified exxonmobil as one of the potentially responsible parties.
the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty
sites could mitigate exxonmobil’s actual joint and several liability exposure.
at present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to
exxonmobil’s operations or financial condition. consolidated company provisions
made in 2018 for environmental liabilities were $330 million ($302 million
in 2017) and the balance sheet reflects liabilities of $875 million as of
december 31, 2018, and $872 million as of december 31, 2017.

crude
oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in
response to changing market forces. the impacts of these price fluctuations on
earnings from upstream, downstream and chemical operations have varied. in the
upstream, a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized
price of oil would have approximately a $450 million annual after-tax effect on
upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of
derivatives. similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic feet change in the worldwide
average gas realization would have approximately a $165 million annual
after-tax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings,
excluding the impact of derivatives. for any given period, the extent of actual
benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual
types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government
take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and
gas production volumes. accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil
and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings
experienced in any particular period. 

in
the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily
determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products
sold. refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner
pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the
range of products produced. these prices in turn depend on global and regional
supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export
balances and weather.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



the global
energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are
adverse to one or more of the corporation’s businesses. such conditions, along
with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times
associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining
a strong financial position. management views the corporation’s financial
strength as a competitive advantage. 

in
general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or
purchase products to/from other segments. instead, where such sales take place,
they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated
refinery/chemical complexes. additionally, intersegment sales are at
market-based prices. the products bought and sold between segments can also be
acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and
transportation capabilities. about 35 percent of the corporation’s intersegment
sales represent upstream production sold to the downstream. other intersegment
sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw
materials, feedstocks and finished products. 

although
price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over
the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions
by opec and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry
economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand. accordingly, the corporation evaluates the viability of its major investments
over a range of prices.

the
corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming
assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment.
the asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure
that all assets are contributing to the corporation’s strategic objectives
resulting in an efficient capital base. 

 

risk management 

the
corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the upstream, downstream and chemical businesses reduce
the corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices,
currency rates and interest rates. in addition, the corporation uses
commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price
risk and for trading purposes. the corporation’s commodity derivatives are not
accounted for under hedge accounting. at times, the corporation also enters
into forward currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material
to the corporation’s financial position as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, or
results of operations for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016. credit risk associated
with the corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors,
including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and
financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. no material market or
credit risks to the corporation’s financial position, results of operations or
liquidity exist as a result of the derivatives described in note 13. the
corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization,
reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.

the
corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its
short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating
interest rates. the impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates
affecting the corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow
or fair value. the corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term
and short-term liquidity. internally generated funds are expected to cover the
majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term
debt. some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and
their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture
projects. 

the
corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to
exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investment transactions. fluctuations in exchange rates are often offsetting
and the impacts on exxonmobil’s geographically and functionally diverse
operations are varied. the corporation makes limited use of currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures
related to the corporation’s limited use of the currency exchange contracts are
not material. 

 

inflation and other uncertainties 

the
general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained
moderate over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs
has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and
productivity improvements. prices for services and materials continue to evolve
in response to constant changes in commodity markets and industry activities,
impacting operating and capital costs. the corporation monitors market trends
and works to minimize costs in all commodity price environments through its
economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project management
practices.

recently issued accounting standards 

 

effective january 1, 2019, the corporation adopted the financial accounting standards board’s standard, leases
(topic 842), as amended. the standard requires all leases to be recorded on
the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability. the
corporation used a transition method that applies the new
lease standard at january 1, 2019, and recognizes any cumulative-effect
adjustments to the opening balance of 2019 retained earnings. the corporation
applied a policy election to exclude short-term leases from balance sheet
recognition and also elected certain practical expedients at adoption. as
permitted under these expedients the corporation did not reassess whether existing
contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for any existing
leases, initial direct costs for any existing lease and whether existing land
easements and rights of way, that were not previously accounted for as leases,
are or contain a lease. at january 1, 2019, the operating lease liability is
estimated to be in the range of $3.3 billion and the operating
lease right of use asset is estimated to be in the range of $4.3 billion, including about $1.0 billion related to prepaid
leases. the cumulative effect adjustment is expected to be de minimis. 

  

 

critical accounting estimates 

the
corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated
business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and
natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural
gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally
accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the
corporation’s accounting policies are summarized in note 1. 

 

oil and natural gas reserves 

the
estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical
evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well
information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, among other
factors. the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the corporation
through long-standing approval guidelines. reserve changes are made within a
well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and
engineering professionals, assisted by the global reserves group which has
significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by
senior management. notably, the corporation does not use specific quantitative
reserve targets to determine compensation. key features of the reserve
estimation process are covered in disclosure of reserves in item 2. 

oil
and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves. 

·        
proved oil and natural
gas reserves are determined in accordance with securities and exchange
commission (sec) requirements. proved reserves are those quantities of oil and
natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under
existing economic and operating conditions and government regulations. proved
reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas
prices during the reporting year.

proved
reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves.
proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. proved
undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major
expenditure is required for completion. proved undeveloped reserves are
recognized only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the
reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific
circumstances support a longer period of time.

the
percentage of proved developed reserves was 68 percent of total proved reserves
at year-end 2018 (including both consolidated and equity company reserves), an
increase from 66 percent in 2017, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten
years. although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will
be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of
factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance,
regulatory approvals, government policy, consumer preferences and significant
changes in long-term oil and natural gas prices.

·        
unproved reserves are quantities
of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability
and include probable reserves. probable reserves are reserves that, together
with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

revisions in previously
estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir
or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or
(3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices
and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. revisions can also
result from significant changes in development strategy or production equipment
and facility capacity.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



unit-of-production depreciation

oil
and natural gas reserve quantities are used as the basis to calculate
unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. depreciation is
calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved
developed reserves applied to actual production. the volumes produced and asset
cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject
to some variability. 

in
the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable
allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative
method is used. the straight-line method may be used in limited situations
where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of
the underlying reserves. for example, certain assets used in the production of
oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the
corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully
depreciated by the end of its useful life.

to the extent that proved reserves for a
property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce
such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable
allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a
unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent sec
price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately
adjusted for production and technical changes. the effect of this approach on
the corporation’s 2018 depreciation expense versus 2017 was immaterial.

impairment

the corporation tests assets or groups of assets for
recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. among the events or
changes in circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an
asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following:

·        
a significant decrease
in the market price of a long-lived asset;

·        
a significant adverse
change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its
physical condition including a significant decrease in current and projected
reserve volumes;

·        
a significant adverse
change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value,
including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

·        
an accumulation of
project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;

·        
a current-period
operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow
losses; and

·        
a current expectation
that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise
disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
life.

asset valuation analyses performed as part of its asset management
program and other profitability reviews assist the corporation in assessing
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any
of its assets may not be recoverable.

in general, the corporation does not view temporarily low prices
or margins as an indication of impairment. management believes that prices over
the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to
meet global demand. although prices will occasionally drop significantly,
industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply
and demand fundamentals. on the supply side, industry production from mature
fields is declining. this is being offset by investments to generate production
from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency
advancements. opec investment activities and production policies also have an
impact on world oil supplies. the demand side is largely a function of general
economic activities and levels of prosperity. because the lifespans of the vast
majority of the corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value
of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity
prices and production costs. during the lifespan of these major assets, the
corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant
volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher
earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. 

in assessing whether the events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation
considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term
view of prices. while near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations,
longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of
assessing future cash flows.

when the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in
commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes
to the corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its
capital investment decisions. to the extent those changes result in a
significant reduction to its long-term oil price, natural gas price or margin
ranges, the corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other
events or changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an
indicator of potential impairment for certain assets.

financial condition and results of operations

 



in the upstream, the standardized measure
of discounted cash flows included in the supplemental information on oil and
gas exploration and production activities is required to use prices based on
the average of first-of-month prices. these prices represent discrete points in
time and could be higher or lower than the corporation’s long-term price
assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. the corporation believes
the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected
future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil
and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore
does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.

if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation estimates the future
undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability
of carrying amounts. in performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the
lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. cash flows used in
recoverability assessments are based on the corporation’s assumptions which are
developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with
the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. these
evaluations make use of the corporation’s assumptions of future capital
allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, refining and chemical
margins, volumes, costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. volumes are based
on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales.
where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these
reserves may be included in the evaluation. cash flow estimates for impairment
testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.

an asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash
flows are less than the asset’s carrying value. impairments are measured by the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. fair value is based on
market prices if an active market exists for the asset group, or discounted
cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. significant
unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances
against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic
chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold
the properties. properties that are not individually significant are aggregated
by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period. 

the corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of
potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. this process
is aligned with the requirements of asc 360 and relies in part on the
corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle. in 2018, the corporation identified
a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that
the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, mainly in north america, may
not be recoverable. accordingly, impairment assessments were performed which
indicated that certain asset groups assessed have future undiscounted cash flow
estimates that do not recover their carrying values. the corporation’s 2018
results include after-tax charges of $0.5 billion to reduce the carrying value
of those assets to fair value.

the assessment of fair
values required the use of level 3 inputs and assumptions that are based upon
the views of a likely market participant. the principal parameters used to
establish fair values included estimates of both proved and unproved reserves,
future commodity prices which were consistent with the average of third-party
industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs,
discount rates ranging from 6 percent to 8 percent depending on the
characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market transactions. factors
which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include
reductions in the corporation’s long-term price outlooks, changes in the
allocation of capital, and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of
efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural gas price increases. however, due
to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the
relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to
reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment
charges related to the corporation’s long-lived assets.

 

asset retirement obligations 

the corporation incurs retirement
obligations for certain assets. the fair values of these obligations are
recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time
the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair value, the corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal
obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical assessments of the
assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and
inflation rates. asset retirement obligations are disclosed in note 9 to the
financial statements. 

 

suspended exploratory well costs 

the corporation continues capitalization
of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the corporation is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project. exploratory well costs not meeting these
criteria are charged to expense. the facts and circumstances that support
continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in note
10 to the financial statements.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



consolidations 

the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the
corporation controls. they also include the corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. amounts representing the corporation’s interest in entities that it
does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 

investments in companies that are
partially owned by the corporation are integral to the corporation’s
operations. in some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others
they provide the only available means of entry into a particular market or area
of interest. the other parties, who also have an equity interest in these
companies, are either independent third parties or host governments that share
in the business results according to their ownership. the corporation does not
invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance
sheet. in fact, the corporation has long been on record supporting an
alternative accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate
its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned companies
rather than only its interest in net equity. this method of accounting for
investments in partially-owned companies is not permitted by u.s. gaap except
where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of upstream assets
and liabilities. however, for purposes of calculating return on average capital
employed, which is not covered by u.s. gaap standards, the corporation includes
its share of debt of these partially-owned companies in the determination of
average capital employed. 

 

pension benefits 

the
corporation and its affiliates sponsor nearly 100 defined benefit (pension)
plans in over 40 countries. the pension and other postretirement benefits footnote
(note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension
expense. 

some
of these plans (primarily non-u.s.) provide pension benefits that are paid
directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than
a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices
do not encourage advance funding. book reserves are established for these
plans. the portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is
expensed as services are rendered. the portion attributable to the increase in
pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the
obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. the primary difference in
pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for
funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund
assets.

for
funded plans, including those in the u.s., pension obligations are financed in
advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements. these plans are
managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and
meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and
government standards at the mandated measurement dates. in determining
liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require
approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.


the
corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as
necessary. all defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding
status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
of the corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate. 

pension
accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term
expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit
obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. pension
assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management.
these assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market
rates and outlook. the long-term expected earnings rate on u.s. pension plan
assets in 2018 was 6 percent. the 10‑year and 20‑year actual
returns on u.s. pension plan assets were 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
the corporation establishes the long‑term expected rate of return by
developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund
asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for
the specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term rate of return is
then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation
percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. a
worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets
would increase annual pension expense by approximately $150 million before tax.


differences between actual returns on fund
assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense
in the year that the difference occurs. such differences are deferred, along
with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense
over the expected remaining service life of employees.

management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations

 



 

litigation contingencies 

a
variety of claims have been made against the corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. the status of significant claims is summarized in note 16. 

the
corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the
incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. these
amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or
claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or
other third parties may be accrued separately. the corporation revises such
accruals in light of new information. for contingencies where an unfavorable
outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the corporation
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. for purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures,
“significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management
believes should be disclosed. 

management judgment is required related to
contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult
to predict. however, the corporation has been successful in defending
litigation in the past. payments have not had a material adverse effect on
operations or financial condition. in the corporation’s experience, large
claims often do not result in large awards. large awards are often reversed or
substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement. 

 

tax contingencies 

the
corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict. 

the benefits of uncertain tax positions
that the corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are
recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.
for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the
financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized. a reserve is established for the difference
between a position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and
the amount recognized in the financial statements. the corporation’s
unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in
note 19.

 

foreign
currency translation 

the
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the
corporation’s international subsidiaries into u.s. dollars is prescribed by u.s.
gaap. under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. the functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment. 

factors considered by management when
determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used
for cash flows related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness
of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the
country; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to
acquire raw materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and
significance of intercompany transactions.

management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting

 



management, including the corporation’s chief executive officer, principal
financial officer, and principal accounting officer, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the corporation’s
financial reporting. management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in internal
control – integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation,
management concluded that exxon mobil corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2018. 

pricewaterhousecoopers
llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the
effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
of december 31, 2018, as stated in their report included in the financial
section of this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm

 





to the board of directors and shareholders
of exxon mobil corporation

opinions on the financial statements and
internal control over financial reporting

we have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of exxon mobil corporation and its subsidiaries
(the “corporation”) as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2018,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). we also have audited the corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018 based on criteria established
in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). 

in our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the corporation as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended december 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the
corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on criteria established
in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the coso.       

basis for opinions

the corporation's management is
responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.
our responsibility is to express opinions on the corporation’s consolidated financial
statements and on the corporation's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public
company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to
be independent with respect to the corporation in accordance with the u.s.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.

we conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud,
and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. 

our audits of the consolidated financial
statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

definition
and limitations of internal control over financial reporting

a company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. a company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

notes to consolidated financial statements


 



the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility
of the management of exxon mobil corporation. 

the
corporation’s principal business involves exploration for, and production of,
crude oil and natural gas and manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude
oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of
specialty products.

the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ
from these estimates. prior years’ data has been reclassified in certain cases
to conform to the 2018 presentation basis. 

 

1. summary of accounting policies 

principles of consolidation and accounting
for investments

the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the
corporation controls. they also include the corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. amounts representing the corporation’s interest in entities that it
does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are
included in “investments, advances and long-term receivables”. the
corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the
consolidated statement of income caption “income from equity affiliates”. 

majority
ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which
subsidiaries are consolidated. however, certain factors may indicate that a
majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. these factors occur where the
minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive
participating rights. these include the right to approve operating policies,
expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation
and succession plans. 

evidence
of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies
accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence
represents a loss in value of the corporation’s investment that is other than
temporary. examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses,
negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil
and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s
business segment or geographic region. if evidence of an other than temporary
loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is
recognized. in the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash
flows are used to assess fair value. 

investments
in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
net income. the corporation uses the modified approach for equity securities
that do not have a readily determinable fair value. this modified approach
measures investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions in a similar
investment of the same issuer.

the
corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment
for equity method investments is reported in “accumulated other comprehensive
income”. 

revenue recognition

the corporation generally sells crude oil,
natural gas and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at
prevailing market prices. in some cases (e.g., natural gas), products may be
sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price adjustments to reflect
market conditions. revenue is recognized at the amount the corporation expects
to receive when the customer has taken control, which is typically when title
transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. the
prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not
available until the next period. in such cases, estimated realizations are
accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is
available. such adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied
in previous periods are not significant. payment for revenue transactions is
typically due within 30 days. future volume delivery obligations that are
unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through
ordinary production or purchases. these performance obligations are based on
market prices at the time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to
market price volatility.

purchases
and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another are combined and recorded as exchanges measured at
the book value of the item sold. 

“sales and other operating revenue” and
“notes and accounts receivable” primarily arise from contracts with customers.
long-term receivables are primarily from non-customers. contract assets are
mainly from marketing assistance programs and are not significant. contract
liabilities are mainly customer prepayments and accruals of expected volume
discounts and are not significant.

income and
other taxes

the
corporation excludes from the consolidated statement of income certain sales
and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing
transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental
authorities. similar taxes, for which the corporation is not considered to be
an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both “sales
and other operating revenue” and “other taxes and duties”).

the
corporation accounts for u.s. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an
income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred. we have elected not
to adopt an option provided by the financial accounting standards board update,
income statement – reporting comprehensive income: reclassification of
certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. the option
allowed the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to
retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs
act.

derivative instruments

the
corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset
exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities and forecasted
transactions. all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value. derivative
assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of
offset exists and certain other criteria are met. collateral payables or receivables
are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.

recognition
and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative
to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative. all gains and losses
from derivative instruments for which the corporation does not apply hedge
accounting are immediately recognized in earnings. we may designate derivatives
as fair value or cash flow hedges. for fair value hedges, the gain or loss from
derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are
recognized in earnings. for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain
or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of
other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the
period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective
portion of the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is recognized
immediately in earnings. 

fair value

fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. hierarchy
levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. hierarchy level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. hierarchy
level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.

inventories

crude
oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current
market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method
– lifo). inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including
depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its
existing condition and location. selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from
inventory cost. inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or
less. 

property, plant and equipment

cost
basis. the corporation
uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and
production activities. under this method, costs are accumulated on a
field-by-field basis. costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a
property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred.
exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a
sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well
and where the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves
and the economic and operating viability of the project. exploratory well costs
not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. other exploratory
expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are
expensed as incurred. development costs, including costs of productive wells
and development dry holes, are capitalized. 

depreciation,
depletion and amortization. depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined
under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which
is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into
consideration.

acquisition costs of proved properties are
amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total
proved oil and gas reserves. capitalized exploratory drilling and development
costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized
using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed
reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing
facilities using current operating methods. under the unit-of-production
method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been
measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the
outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. in the event that the
unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost
over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. the
straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of
the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves.
for example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have
a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the corporation uses
straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end
of its useful life.

to
the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and
that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge
does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life,
assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves
determined at the most recent sec price which results in a more meaningful quantity
of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical
changes. 

investments
in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are
generally depreciated on a straight‑line basis over a 25-year life.
service station buildings and fixed improvements generally are depreciated over
a 20-year life. maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance,
are expensed as incurred. major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the
assets replaced are retired.

impairment
assessment. the
corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing
basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. among the events or changes in circumstances
which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not
be recoverable are the following:

·        
a significant decrease
in the market price of a long-lived asset;

·        
a significant adverse
change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its
physical condition including a significant decrease in current and projected
reserve volumes;

·        
a significant adverse
change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value,
including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

·        
an accumulation of
project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;

·        
a current-period
operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow
losses; and

·        
a current expectation
that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise
disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful
life.

asset valuation analyses performed as part of its asset management
program and other profitability reviews assist the corporation in assessing
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any
of its assets may not be recoverable.

in general, the corporation does not view temporarily low prices
or margins as an indication of impairment. management believes that prices over
the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to
meet global demand. although prices will occasionally drop significantly,
industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply
and demand fundamentals. on the supply side, industry production from mature
fields is declining. this is being offset by investments to generate production
from new discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency
advancements. opec investment activities and production policies also have an
impact on world oil supplies. the demand side is largely a function of general
economic activities and levels of prosperity. because the lifespans of the vast
majority of the corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value
of these assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity
prices and production costs. during the lifespan of these major assets, the
corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant
volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods of higher
earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. in assessing whether
the events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable, the corporation considers recent periods of operating
losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices. while near-term prices
are subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and
meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.

when the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in
commodity prices, the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes
to the corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its
capital investment decisions. to the extent those changes result in a
significant reduction to its long-term oil price, natural gas price or margin
ranges, the corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other
events or changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an
indicator of potential impairment for certain assets.

in the upstream, the standardized measure
of discounted cash flows included in the supplemental information on oil and
gas exploration and production activities is required to use prices based on
the average of first-of-month prices. these prices represent discrete points in
time and could be higher or lower than the corporation’s long-term price
assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. the corporation believes
the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected
future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil
and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves and therefore
does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment.

if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation estimates the future
undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability
of carrying amounts. in performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the
lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. cash flows used in
recoverability assessments are based on the corporation’s assumptions which are
developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with
the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. these
evaluations make use of the corporation’s assumptions of future capital
allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, refining and chemical
margins, volumes, costs, and foreign currency exchange rates. volumes are based
on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales.
where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these
reserves may be included in the evaluation. cash flow estimates for impairment
testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.

an asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted
cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value. impairments are measured
by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. fair value is
based on market prices if an active market exists for the asset group, or discounted
cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. significant
unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation
allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated
economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects
to hold the properties. properties that are not individually significant are
aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average
holding period. 

 

other.
gains on sales of proved
and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty
about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any
substantial obligation for future performance by the corporation. losses on
properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held
for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value.

interest
costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of
multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring
the constructed assets. the project construction phase commences with the
development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed
assets are ready for their intended use. capitalized interest costs are
included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service
life of the related assets. 

 

asset retirement obligations and
environmental liabilities

the corporation
incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values of these
obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is
typically at the time the assets are installed. the costs associated with these
liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated. over
time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value. 

liabilities
for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have
been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. these liabilities
are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash
expenditures are not discounted.  

 

foreign currency translation

the
corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international
subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which
each subsidiary operates. 

downstream
and chemical operations primarily use the local currency. however, the u.s.
dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in
latin america) and singapore, which predominantly sells into the u.s. dollar
export market. upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and
integrated within a particular country, such as canada, the united kingdom,
norway and continental europe, use the local currency. some upstream
operations, primarily in asia and africa, use the u.s. dollar because they
predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into u.s.
dollar-denominated markets. 

for
all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions
into the functional currency are included in income.

2. accounting changes 

  

effective january 1, 2018, exxonmobil adopted the financial
accounting standards board’s standard, revenue from contracts with customers
(topic 606), as amended. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry and
transaction specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the
standard was adopted using the modified retrospective method, under which prior
year results are not restated, but supplemental information is provided for any
material impacts of the standard on 2018 results. the adoption of the standard
did not have a material impact on any of the lines reported in the
corporation’s financial statements. the cumulative effect of adoption of the
standard was de minimis. the corporation did not elect any practical expedients
that require disclosure.

effective january 1, 2018, exxonmobil
adopted the financial accounting standards board’s update, financial
instruments –  overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and
measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the standard requires investments in
equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value
recognized through net income. the corporation elected a modified approach for
equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. this
modified approach measures investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus
or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly
transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. the
cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of this standard increased
opening 2018 retained earnings $47 million. 

effective january 1, 2018, exxonmobil
adopted the financial accounting standards board’s update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires separate presentation of the service cost component from other
components of net benefit costs. the other components are reported in a new
line on the corporation’s statement of income, “non-service pension and
postretirement benefit expense”. the corporation elected to use the practical
expedient which uses the amounts disclosed in the pension and other
postretirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative periods as the
estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements, as
it is impracticable to determine the amounts capitalized in those periods.
beginning in 2018, the other components of net benefit costs are included in
the corporate and financing segment. the estimated after-tax impact from the
change in segmentation is an increase in corporate and financing expenses of
about $450 million for 2018. the increase in the corporate and
financing expenses is offset by lower expenses across the operating segments. additionally, only the service cost
component of net benefit costs is eligible for capitalization in situations
where it is otherwise appropriate to capitalize employee costs in connection
with the construction or production of an asset. 

the impact of the retrospective
presentation change on exxonmobil's consolidated statement of income for 2017
and 2016 is shown below.

effective january 1, 2019, the corporation
adopted the financial accounting standards
board’s standard, leases (topic 842), as amended. the standard requires
all leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a
lease liability. the corporation used a transition
method that applies the new lease standard at january 1, 2019, and recognizes
any cumulative-effect adjustments to the opening balance of 2019 retained
earnings. the corporation applied a policy election to exclude short-term
leases from balance sheet recognition and also elected certain practical
expedients at adoption. as permitted under these expedients the corporation did
not reassess whether existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease
classification for any existing leases, initial direct costs for any existing
lease and whether existing land easements and rights of way, that were not
previously accounted for as leases, are or contain a lease. at january 1, 2019,
the operating lease liability is estimated to be in the range of $3.3 billion and the operating lease right of use
asset is estimated to be in the range of $4.3 billion, including about $1.0 billion related
to prepaid leases. the cumulative effect adjustment is expected to be de
minimis.

notes to consolidated financial statements


 



7. equity company information 

the
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see note 1). these companies are primarily engaged in oil
and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in north america;
natural gas exploration, production and distribution in europe; liquefied
natural gas (lng) operations and transportation of crude oil in africa; and
exploration, production, lng operations, and the manufacture and sale of
petroleum and petrochemical products in asia and the middle east. also included
are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing and marketing ventures. 

the
share of total equity company revenues from sales to exxonmobil consolidated
companies was 14 percent, 15 percent and 14 percent in the years
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

the corporation’s
ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint
ventures as well as interests in partnerships. differences between the
company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in
the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to
specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the factors
giving rise to the difference. the amortization of this difference, as
appropriate, is included in “income from equity affiliates” on the consolidated
statement of income.

the corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of
potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. this process
is aligned with the requirements of asc 360 and relies in part on the
corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle. in 2018, the corporation identified
a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that
the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, mainly in north america, may
not be recoverable. accordingly, impairment assessments were performed which
indicated that certain asset groups assessed have future undiscounted cash flow
estimates that do not recover their carrying values. the corporation’s 2018
results include before-tax charges of $0.7 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets to
fair value. in 2017 and 2016, the corporation recognized before-tax impairment
charges of $2.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.

notes to consolidated financial statements


 



the assessment of fair values required the
use of level 3 inputs and assumptions that are based upon the views of a likely
market participant. the principal parameters used to establish fair values
included estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity
prices which were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts
and government agencies, drilling and development costs, a range of discount
rates depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable
market transactions. factors which could put further assets at risk of
impairment in the future include reductions in the corporation’s long-term
price outlooks, changes in the allocation of capital, and operating cost
increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural
gas price increases. however, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting
future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry prices and
costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of
any potential future impairment charges related to the corporation’s long-lived
assets.

accumulated
depreciation and depletion totaled $230,089 million at the end of 2018
and $224,555 million at the end of
2017. interest capitalized in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $652 million, $749 million and $708 million, respectively. 

  

 

asset retirement obligations 

the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations
incurred in the current period were level 3 fair value measurements. the costs
associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets
and depreciated as the reserves are produced. over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value. 

asset
retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become
firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled. these
obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil
remediation. however, these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for
continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal
obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future
settlement dates of such obligations.

10. accounting for suspended exploratory
well costs 

the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

the
following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended
exploratory well costs as well as an aging summary of those costs.

exploration activity often involves
drilling multiple wells, over a number of years, to fully evaluate a project.
the table below provides a breakdown of the number of projects with only
exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less and those
that have had exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of greater than
one year.

(7) advances to/receivables from equity companies and long-term
obligations to equity companies are mainly designated as hierarchy level 3
inputs. the fair value is calculated by discounting the remaining obligations
by a rate consistent with the credit quality and industry of the equity
company.
  
 




the estimated fair value of total
long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease obligations, was $23.7 billion at december 31, 2017, as compared
to recorded book values of $23.1 billion at december 31,
2017.

notes to consolidated financial statements


 



derivative
instruments. the
corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the upstream, downstream and chemical businesses reduce
the corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices,
currency rates and interest rates. in addition, the corporation uses
commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price
risk and for trading purposes. the corporation’s commodity derivatives are not
accounted for under hedge accounting. at times, the corporation also enters
into forward currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material
to the corporation’s financial position as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, or
results of operations for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016.

credit
risk associated with the corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by
several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the
quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. the
corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization,
reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.

the carrying values of derivative
instruments on the consolidated balance sheet, at december 31, 2017, were gross
assets of $25 million, gross liabilities

14. long-term debt 

at
december 31, 2018, long-term debt consisted of $19,940 million due
in u.s. dollars and $598 million representing the u.s. dollar equivalent
at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. these
amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $4,070 million, which
matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. the amounts of
long-term debt, including capitalized lease obligations, maturing in each of
the four years after december 31, 2019, in millions of dollars, are: 2020
– $1,639; 2021 – $2,571; 2022 – $1,841; and 2023 – $1,304.
at december 31, 2018, the corporation’s unused long-term credit lines were $0.2 billion.

15. incentive program 

the 2003 incentive program provides for
grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (sars), restricted stock and
other forms of awards. awards may be granted to eligible employees of the
corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned. outstanding
awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or
award instrument. options and sars may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on
the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. the maximum number of
shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 incentive program is 220 million. awards that are
forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum
limit. the 2003 incentive program does not have a specified term. new awards
may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the board
terminates the plan early. at the end of 2018, remaining shares available for
award under the 2003 incentive program were 82 million.
 

restricted
stock and restricted stock units. awards totaling 8,771 thousand, 8,916 thousand, and 9,583 thousand of restricted
(nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. compensation expense
for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is
recognized in income over the requisite service period. shares for these awards
are issued to employees from treasury stock. the units that are settled in cash
are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over
the vesting period.
during the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold
or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. the majority of the awards have
graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and
units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after
seven years. awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting
periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and
of 10 years or retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award. 

the
corporation has purchased shares in the open market and through negotiated
transactions to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with benefit plans and programs. purchases may be discontinued at any time
without prior notice.

as of december 31, 2018, there was $1,899 million of unrecognized compensation cost
related to the nonvested restricted awards. this cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 4.4 years. the compensation cost charged
against income for the restricted stock and restricted stock units was $774 million, $856 million and $880 million for 2018, 2017
and 2016, respectively. the income tax benefit recognized in income related to
this compensation expense was $42 million, $78 million and $80 million for the same
periods, respectively. the fair value of shares and units vested in 2018, 2017
and 2016 was $722 million, $826 million and $851 million,
respectively. cash payments of $61 million, $64 million and $67 million for vested
restricted stock units settled in cash were made in 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

16. litigation and other contingencies 

litigation. a
variety of claims have been made against exxonmobil and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. the corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those
contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no
amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the
minimum of the range is accrued. the corporation does not record liabilities
when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be
only reasonably possible or remote. for contingencies where an unfavorable
outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the corporation
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. for purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant”
includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes
should be disclosed. exxonmobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in
these matters. based on a consideration of all relevant facts and
circumstances, the corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any
currently pending lawsuit against exxonmobil will have a material adverse
effect upon the corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial
statements taken as a whole.

other contingencies. the corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at december 31, 2018,
for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure.

additionally, the corporation and its affiliates have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities,
all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the corporation’s operations or financial condition.

in accordance with a venezuelan
nationalization decree issued in february 2007, a subsidiary of the venezuelan
national oil company (pdvsa) assumed the operatorship of the cerro negro heavy
oil project. the decree also required conversion of the cerro negro project
into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in pdvsa’s or one of its affiliate’s
ownership interest in the project. exxonmobil refused to accede to the terms
proffered by the government, and on june 27, 2007, the government expropriated
exxonmobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the
cerro negro project.

exxonmobil collected awards of $908 million in an arbitration
against pdvsa under the rules of the international chamber of commerce in
respect of an indemnity related to the cerro negro project and $260 million in an arbitration
for compensation due for the la ceiba project and for export curtailments at
the cerro negro project under rules of international centre for settlement of
investment disputes (icsid). an icsid arbitration award relating to the cerro
negro project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) was annulled
based on a determination that a prior tribunal failed to adequately explain why
the cap on damages in the indemnity owed by pdvsa did not affect or limit the
amount owed for the expropriation of the cerro negro project. exxonmobil filed
a new claim seeking to restore the original award of damages for the cerro
negro project with icsid on september 26, 2018.

the net impact of this matter on the
corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
regardless, the corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material
effect upon the corporation’s operations or financial condition.

an affiliate
of exxonmobil is one of the contractors under a production sharing contract
(psc) with the nigerian national petroleum corporation (nnpc) covering the erha
block located in the offshore waters of nigeria. exxonmobil's affiliate is the
operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the
psc. the contractors are in dispute with nnpc regarding nnpc's lifting of crude
oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the psc. in accordance with
the terms of the psc, the contractors initiated arbitration in abuja, nigeria,
under the nigerian arbitration and conciliation act. on october 24, 2011, a
three-member arbitral tribunal issued an award upholding the contractors'
position in all material respects and awarding damages to the contractors
jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued
interest. the contractors petitioned a nigerian federal court for enforcement
of the award, and nnpc petitioned the same court to have the award set aside.
on may 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. the contractors appealed that
judgment to the court of appeal, abuja judicial division. on july 22, 2016, the
court of appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award.
on october 21, 2016, the contractors appealed the decision to the supreme court
of nigeria. in june 2013, the contractors filed a lawsuit against nnpc in the
nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to seek
enforcement of the psc in the courts if necessary. following dismissal by this
court, the contractors appealed to the nigerian court of appeal in june 2016.
in october 2014, the contractors filed suit in the united states district court
for the southern district of new york to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration
award against nnpc assets residing within that jurisdiction. nnpc has moved to
dismiss the lawsuit. at this time, the net impact of this matter on the
corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
however, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the corporation
does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
corporation's operations or financial condition.

(1)   benefit payments for funded and
unfunded plans.

(2)   for 2018 and 2017,
other postretirement benefits paid are net of $13 million and $16 million of
medicare subsidy receipts, respectively.

 

for selection of the discount rate for
u.s. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest
rate market indicators and the effective discount rate determined by use of a
yield curve based on high-quality, noncallable bonds applied to the estimated
cash outflows for benefit payments. for major non-u.s. plans, the discount rate
is determined by using a spot yield curve of high-quality,
local-currency-denominated bonds at an average maturity approximating that of
the liabilities. 

the measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5 percent in 2020 and subsequent years. a
one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost trend rate would increase
service and interest cost by $74 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by $776 million. a
one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease
service and interest cost by $56 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by $620 million.

notes to consolidated financial statements


 



the funding levels of all qualified
pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or
regulation. as shown in the table below, certain smaller u.s. pension plans and
a number of non-u.s. pension plans are not funded because local applicable tax rules
and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. all
defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status
of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
of the corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

the authoritative guidance for defined
benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires an employer to
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position
and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes
occur through other comprehensive income.

the long-term
expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each
benefit plan by developing a forward‑looking, long-term return assumption
for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected
real return for the specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term
rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset
class.

the corporation’s investment strategy for
benefit plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the
risks inherent in plan assets and liabilities and broad diversification to
reduce the risk of the portfolio. the benefit plan assets are primarily
invested in passive global equity and local currency fixed income index
funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. the equity funds hold
exxonmobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity
index. the fixed income funds are largely invested in investment grade
corporate and government debt securities. 

studies
are periodically conducted to establish the preferred target asset allocation
percentages. the target asset allocation for the u.s. benefit plans and the major
non-u.s. plans is 30 percent equity securities
and 70 percent debt securities.
the equity targets for the u.s. and certain non-u.s. plans include a small
allocation to private equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage
venture capital of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. 

the
fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different
methods of valuing assets. the terms do not represent the relative risk or
credit quality of an investment.

(1)   per asu 2015-07, certain instruments that are measured at
fair value using the net asset value (nav) per share practical expedient have
not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. the fair value amounts
presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value
hierarchy to the total value of plan assets. 

(2)   for non-u.s. equity securities held
in separate accounts, fair value is based on observable quoted prices on active
exchanges. 

(3)   for corporate, government and
asset-backed debt securities, fair value is based on observable inputs of
comparable market transactions.

(4)   for government debt securities that
are traded on active exchanges, fair value is based on observable quoted
prices. 

(5)   for cash balances that are subject
to withdrawal penalties or other adjustments, the fair value is treated as a
level 2 input.

18. disclosures about segments and related
information 

the
upstream, downstream and chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. the factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. the upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. the downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. the chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. these
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries. 

these
functions have been defined as the operating segments of the corporation
because they are the segments (1) that engage in business activities from
which revenues are recognized and expenses are incurred; (2) whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporation’s chief operating
decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment
and to assess its performance; and (3) for which discrete financial
information is available. 

earnings
after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.

the corporation’s undistributed earnings
from subsidiary companies outside the united states include amounts that have
been retained to fund prior and future capital project expenditures. deferred
income taxes have not been recorded for potential future tax obligations, such
as foreign withholding tax and state tax, as these undistributed earnings are
expected to be indefinitely reinvested for the foreseeable future. as of
december 31, 2018, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred
tax liability. however, unrecognized deferred taxes on remittance of these
funds are not expected to be material.

unrecognized tax benefits. the corporation is subject to income
taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. unrecognized tax benefits
reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on
income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. the

the gross unrecognized tax benefit
balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would
reduce the corporation’s effective tax rate if the positions are favorably
resolved. unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not
increase the effective tax rate. the 2018, 2017 and 2016 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the corporation’s
net income. 

resolution
of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities
or through litigation will take many years to complete. it is difficult to
predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not
entirely within the control of the corporation. in the united states, the
corporation has various ongoing u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with
the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. the corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse
effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

it
is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could
increase or decrease by 10 percent in the next 12
months with no material impact on the corporation's net income.

oil and gas exploration and production
costs 

the amounts shown for net capitalized
costs of consolidated subsidiaries are $13,474 million less at year-end 2018
and $15,292 million less at year-end 2017 than the amounts reported as
investments in property, plant and equipment for the upstream in note 9.
this is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain
transportation and research assets and assets relating to lng operations.
assets related to oil sands and oil shale mining operations are included
in the capitalized costs in accordance with financial accounting standards
board rules.

costs (continued) 

the
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs
charged to expense during the year. costs incurred also include new asset
retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or
decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost
estimates or abandonment date. total consolidated costs incurred in 2018 were $16,328 million,
down $3,316 million from 2017, due primarily to lower acquisition costs of
unproved properties, partially offset by higher development costs. in 2017
costs were $19,644 million, up $8,269 million from 2016, due primarily to
acquisitions of unproved properties, partially offset by lower development
costs including lower asset retirement obligation cost estimates mainly in the
north sea. total equity company costs incurred in 2018 were $3,031 million, down
$2,977 million from 2017, due primarily to lower acquisition costs of unproved
properties.

oil and gas reserves 

the following information describes
changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at
year-end 2016, 2017 and 2018. 

the
definitions used are in accordance with the securities and exchange
commission’s rule 4-10 (a) of regulation s-x. 

proved
oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas,
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward,
from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal
is reasonably certain. in some cases, substantial new investments in additional
wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.


in
accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s (sec) rules, the
corporation’s year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change
categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the
basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of
the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period.
these reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit‑of-production
depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted
net cash flows. 

revisions
can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of
proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new
geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of
first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the
estimation of reserves. revisions can also result from significant changes in
either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity. reserve
volumes that were subject to a downward revision can be revised upward at some
point in the future when price levels increase, costs decline, and / or
operating efficiencies occur. 

proved
reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation
in proved reserves and exxonmobil’s ownership percentage of the proved reserves
of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. natural gas
reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from
the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants.
these liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas
liquids. 

in
the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves
are reported separately. however, the corporation does not view equity company
reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies. 

reserves
reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are
based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the
agreement. the production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements
typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. as oil and natural
gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase;
however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value
will typically be lower because of the higher prices. when prices decrease, the
opposite effect generally occurs. the percentage of total liquids and natural
gas proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at
year-end 2018 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements
was 8 percent of liquids, 10 percent of natural gas and 9 percent on an
oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at
six billion cubic feet per one million barrels). 

net
proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in
which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the
cost of a new well. net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 

crude
oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the
net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobil’s oil and natural gas reserves. the
natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for
sale by the producing function as reported in the operating information due to
volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.

the
changes between 2018 year-end proved reserves and 2017 year-end proved reserves
include upward revisions of 3.4 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl as a result
of improved prices; downward natural gas revisions for the groningen field in
the netherlands; and extensions/discoveries primarily in the united states. in 2018, the dutch cabinet notified parliament of its intention to
further reduce previously legislated groningen gas extraction in response to
seismic events over the last several years. in anticipation of a lower
production outlook, the corporation reduced its estimate of proved reserves by
0.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels for the groningen gas field.

the
changes between 2017 year-end proved reserves and 2016 year-end proved reserves
primarily reflect extensions/discoveries in the united states, guyana, and the
united arab emirates, as well as purchases in the permian basin and offshore
area 4 in mozambique, along with upward revisions to north america natural gas,
liquids in the united arab emirates, and bitumen at kearl and cold lake.
downward revisions are reflected in europe for the groningen gas field. 

the
downward revisions in 2016, as the result of very low prices during 2016,
included the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl. in addition, 0.8
billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of north america no longer
qualified as proved reserves at year-end 2016 mainly due to the acceleration of
the projected end-of-field-life.

standardized measure of discounted future cash flows 

as required by the financial accounting
standards board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10
percent to net proved reserves. the standardized measure includes costs
for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
the corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the corporation’s expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. the standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including
first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time
and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year
as prices change.

(1)   
securities and
exchange commission (sec)
rules require the corporation’s reserves to be calculated on the basis of
average first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. as
a result of very low prices during 2016, under the sec definition of proved
reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved
reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016.
future net cash flows for these quantities are excluded from the 2016
standardized measure of discounted future cash flows. substantially all of this
reduction in discounted future net cash flows since december 31, 2015, is
reflected in the line “net change in prices, lifting and development costs” in
the table above.
