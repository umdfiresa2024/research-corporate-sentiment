item 1.    business        

general  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our company, a delaware
corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the businesses of huntsman holdings, llc, a company founded by jon m. huntsman. mr. huntsman founded the predecessor to our company in 1970
as a small polystyrene plastics packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of significant acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 


we
operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999. 

our
principal executive offices are located at 500 huntsman way, salt lake city, utah 84108, and our telephone number at that location is (801) 584-5700. 


recent developments  

po/mtbe joint venture in china  

on november 13, 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec ("nanjing jinling"). the joint
venture will involve the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we will have a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec will hold a 51%
interest. our equity investment is anticipated to be approximately $120 million, and we expect to receive significant license fees from the joint venture. the timing of equity contributions and
license fee payments depends on various factors, but the majority are intended to be made over the course of the construction period of the plant (expected to be completed by the end of 2014). 

overview  

our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and
industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and
non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading
global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide. our
administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below, which are located in 30
countries. as of december 31, 2012, we employed approximately 12,000 associates worldwide. our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $11,187 million,
$11,221 million and $9,250 million, respectively. 

we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments. in a series of transactions beginning in 2006, we sold our north
american polymers and base chemicals operations and substantially shutdown all of our australian styrenics operations. we report the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in our
statements of operations. see "note 25. discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements.

our products  

we produce differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and
textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products. 

growth
in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. accordingly, the profitability
of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the petrochemical industry. our pigments business, while cyclical, is influenced by seasonal
demand patterns in the coatings industry.

polyurethanes  

general  

we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including mdi products, po, polyols, pg
and tpu. polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. we focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for mdi and
mdi-based polyurethane systems. growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi-based products for other materials across a
broad range of applications. we operate 5 primary polyurethanes manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. we also operate 17 polyurethanes formulation facilities, which are located in
close proximity to our customers worldwide. 

our
customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as mdi or tdi, with polyols, which are derived largely from po and eo. while the range of
tdi-based products is relatively limited, we are able to produce over 2,000 distinct mdi-based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the
proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations. as a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from mdi, are continuing to replace
traditional products in a wide range of end use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, adhesives, wood binders, footwear and other
specialized engineering applications. 

we
are one of three north american producers of po. we and some of our customers process po into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, pg and various other
chemical products. end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings
and cleaning products industries. we also produce mtbe as a co-product of our po manufacturing process. mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle
emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. see "—item 1a. risk factors." 


in
1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china. we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated
polyurethanes formulation facility. in january 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai, china. production at our mdi finishing
plant near shanghai, china operated by hps, a consolidated joint venture, was commissioned on june 30, 2006. production at the mnb, aniline and crude mdi plants operated by slic, an
unconsolidated joint venture, commenced on september 30, 2006. these world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the
significant demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. additionally, in november 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture to build a world scale po
and mtbe plant in nanjing, china. the facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2014, and it will utilize our proprietary po/mtbe manufacturing technology. we will own a 49% interest in the
joint venture. 

during
2012, our polyurethanes segment implemented a restructuring program to reduce annualized fixed costs by $75 million by the third quarter of 2013. in connection with this
program, we recorded restructuring expenses of $38 million during 2012 primarily for workforce reductions.

products and markets  

mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam and coatings,
adhesives, sealants and elastomers. polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with mdi and tdi in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam
applications. po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols. the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. 



  

polyurethane
chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. depending on their needs, customers will use either commodity polyurethane
chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. by varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are
able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products. 


mdi.    mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than tdi. this is primarily because mdi can be used to
make polyurethanes
with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications than tdi. we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued substitution of
mdi-based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction. we expect that other markets, such as binders for reconstituted wood
board products, specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi. 


with
the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies, the asian markets have now become the largest market for mdi. 

tpu.    tpu is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with
polyols to
produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the
specific requirements of our customers. tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. it is also extruded into films, wires and cables for use in a
wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets.

table of contents

polyols.    polyols are combined with mdi, tdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products. demand
for specialty polyols
has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown. 

aniline.    aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi. generally, aniline is either consumed internally
by the producers of
the aniline or is sold to third parties under long-term supply contracts. we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, mdi
manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract. 


po.    po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg. demand for po depends largely on
overall economic demand,
especially that of consumer durables. the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po. 



  

mtbe.    mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of
gasoline. while mtbe
has been effectively eliminated in the united states, demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. in 2011 we announced the signing of a license agreement with chinese chemicals
manufacturer yantai wanhua polyurethanes co., ltd, for the production of po and mtbe. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors." we continue to sell mtbe for use as a gasoline
additive, substantially all of which is sold for use outside the u.s. see "—manufacturing and operations" below and "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations." 

sales and marketing  

our global sales group markets our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,500 customers in more than 90 countries. our sales and technical
resources are organized to support major regional markets, as well as key end use markets which require a more global approach. these key end use markets include the appliance, automotive, footwear,
furniture and coatings, construction products, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries.

table of contents

we
provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we provide the total isocyanate and
polyol formulation to our customers in ready-to-use form. our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers' needs
is critical to our long-term success. we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as "systems houses," close to
our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides
opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers. we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers' requirements. 

we
believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have
facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by
providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service. 

manufacturing and operations  

our mdi production facilities are located in geismar, louisiana; rozenburg, the netherlands; and through our joint ventures in caojing,
china. these facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of mdi, from our facilities located in geismar, louisiana; wilton, u.k.; and caojing, china. we believe that
this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers. in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw
materials, integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices.

our approximately 78% share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation. 
 
at
both our geismar and rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our mdi. this technology, which is also used in our chinese joint venture,
contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer. in addition to mdi, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po. we own or license all technology and know-how
developed and utilized at our po facility. our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming tbhp and tba, which are further processed into po
and mtbe, respectively. because our po production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our

po
co-products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives. 

we
operate polyurethane systems houses in buenos aires, argentina; deer park, australia; taboão da serra, brazil; shanghai, china; cartagena, colombia; deggendorf,
germany; osnabrück, germany; pune, india; gandaria, jakarta, indonesia; ternate, italy; tlalnepantla, mexico; mississauga, ontario; obninsk, russia; dammam, saudi arabia; kuan yin,
taiwan; samutprakarn, thailand; and istanbul, turkey. 

in
july 2012, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 55% ownership interest in international polyurethane investments b.v. (the "russian systems house acquisition"). this
company's wholly-owned subsidiary, huntsman nmg zao, is a leading supplier of polyurethane systems to the adhesives, coatings and footwear markets in russia, ukraine and belarus and is headquartered
in obninsk, russia. 


joint ventures  

rubicon joint venture.    chemtura corporation is our joint venture partner in rubicon llc, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene
and dpa
manufacturing facilities in geismar, louisiana. we are entitled to approximately 78% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc, and chemtura corporation is entitled to
100% of the dpa production. in addition to operating the joint venture's aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa facilities, rubicon llc also operates our wholly owned mdi, polyol and maleic anhydride
facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex. as a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs
for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements. 

chinese mdi joint ventures.    we are involved in two related joint ventures which operate mdi production facilities near shanghai,
china. slic, our
manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies, produces mnb, aniline and crude mdi. we effectively own 35% of slic and account for our investment under the equity method.
hps, our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd, manufactures pure mdi, polymeric mdi and mdi variants. we own 70% of hps and it is a consolidated affiliate.
these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. the total production capacity of the slic facilities is 660 million pounds
per year of mdi and the splitting capacity of the hps facility is 339 million pounds per year of mdi. 

chinese po/mtbe joint venture.    on november 13, 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with
sinopec. the joint
venture will involve the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we will have a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec will hold a 51%
interest. our equity investment is anticipated to be approximately $120 million, and we expect to receive significant license fees from the joint venture. the timing of equity contributions and
license fee payments depends on various factors, but the majority are intended to be made over the course of the construction period of the plant (expected to be completed by the end of 2014). 

raw materials  

the primary raw materials for mdi-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po. benzene is a widely available commodity
that is the primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline. historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. we purchase benzene from third parties to
manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce mdi.

table of contents 

a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po. the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us
access to a competitively priced, strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products. the primary raw materials used in our po production process are
butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen. we purchase a large portion of our raw materials under long-term contracts. 

competition  

our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include basf, bayer, dow, yantai wanhua and lyondellbasell. while these
competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. our polyurethane chemicals business competes in
two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on
technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with
innovative solutions to their needs. 

some
of our competitors in the polyurethanes segment are among the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies. these competitors may have their own raw
material resources. some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. in addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them
to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. if any of our current or future competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them
to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. 


performance products  

general  

our performance products segment has leading positions in the manufacture and sale of amines, surfactants and maleic anhydride and
serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets. we are organized by strategic business units ("sbus") which differentiate between specialties and intermediates. 

in
our specialty sbus (energy, materials, additives, processing chemicals and agrochemicals) we are a leading global producer of amines, carbonates, maleic anhydride and specialty
surfactants. growth in demand in our specialty markets tends to be driven by the end-performance characteristics that our products deliver to our customers. these products are manufactured
for use in a growing number of niche industrial end uses and have been characterized by growing demand, technology substitution and stable profitability. for example, we are one of two significant
global producers of polyetheramines, for which our sales volumes have grown at a compound annual rate of over 8% in the last 10 years due to strong demand in a number of industrial
applications, such as epoxy curing agents, oil drilling, agrochemicals, fuel additives and civil construction materials. we are the leading global licensor of maleic anhydride manufacturing technology
and are also the largest supplier of butane fixed bed catalyst used in the manufacture of maleic anhydride. our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other performance products
businesses and other segments. 

in
our intermediate sbus we consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, lab, and ethanolamines products, which are
primarily used in detergency, consumer products and industrial applications. we also produce eg, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and pet packaging. we operate 19

we
believe we are the largest global producer of maleic anhydride, a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce uprs, which are mainly used in the production of
fiberglass reinforced resins for marine, automotive and construction products. maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. we have the
capacity to produce approximately 572 million pounds annually at our facilities located in pensacola, florida; geismar, louisiana; and moers, germany. we also license our maleic anhydride
technology and supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers. as a result of our long-standing research and development efforts aided by our pilot and catalyst
preparation plants, we have successfully introduced six generations of our maleic anhydride catalysts and now have a seventh generation catalyst commercially available. revenue from licensing and
catalyst comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and catalyst change schedules. our key maleic anhydride customers include akzonobel, chevron oronite, ccp composites,
lubrizol, infineum, reichhold, tate & lyle, cranston print, and gulf bayport.

amines.    amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various
ethylene and propylene
derivatives. generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, detergent, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. growth in demand for amines is highly correlated
with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets. however, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have grown at rates well in excess
of gdp growth due to new product development, technical innovation, and substitution and replacement of competing products. for example, polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly
sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing
materials. ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia. they are used in the production of a variety of industrial, agricultural and consumer products. there are
a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end use
application, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. 


morpholine/dga® agent.    morpholine and dga® agent are produced as co-products by reacting ammonia with deg.
morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber 

11




 

table of contents

curing
(as an accelerator) and flocculants for water treatment. dga® agent is primarily used in gas treating, electronics, herbicides and metalworking end use applications. 


carbonates.    ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide. carbonates are used as
solvents and as
reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications. they are also increasingly being used as a photo-resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards, solar panels, lcd screens and the
production of lithium batteries. 

maleic anhydride and licensing    maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or
normal butane through the
use of a catalyst. the largest use of maleic anhydride in the u.s. is in the production of uprs, which we believe account for approximately 48% of north american maleic anhydride demand. upr is the
main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced
resins, which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. 

our
maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy-efficient,
high-percentage solvent recovery system. this process competes against two other processes, the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery. we believe that our process
is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. the maleic anhydride-based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over
the other routes, which include po, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. as a result, the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. 

total
north american demand for maleic anhydride in 2012 was approximately 621 million pounds. generally, changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity
utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs.

surfactants.    surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble
component in the
same molecule. while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting
properties in a variety of industries. 

demand
growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved
performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and
properties. for basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. 

lab.    lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear
alpha olefins. nearly
all the lab produced globally is converted into las, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. 

three
major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america: procter & gamble, henkel and sun products. we believe that two-thirds of the
lab global capacity lies in the hands of ten producers, with three or four major producers in each of the three regional markets. although the north american market for lab is mature, we expect latin
american and other developing countries to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than gdp. growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is expected to be higher than gdp.
we have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market. with 

13




 

table of contents

a
significant technical barrier to entry, our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus lab-only
producers. 

eg.    we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg: meg, deg and teg. meg is consumed primarily in the
polyester (fiber and
bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. deg is consumed
internally for the production of morpholine and dga® agent and polyols. teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is
sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. we continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg. 

sales and marketing  

we sell over 2,000 products to over 4,000 customers globally through our performance products marketing groups, which have extensive
market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships. 


in
our specialty markets (energy, materials, additives, processing chemicals and agrochemicals), our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain
customer applications. we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers. 

our
intermediates are sold mainly into the global home and personal care market for which we have a dedicated marketing group. we also sell eg. 

we
also provide extensive pre- and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research
and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. finally, these technical service professionals interact closely with our market
managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. in addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of
distributors and agents that also sell our products. these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales
forces.

table of contents 


base resins and specialty component markets.    our products are used in the formulation of products for the protection of steel and
concrete
substrates, such as flooring, metal furniture and appliances, buildings, linings for storage tanks and food and beverage cans, and the primer coat of automobile bodies and ships. epoxy-based surface
coatings are among the most widely used industrial coatings due to their structural stability and broad application functionality combined with overall economic efficiency. 

base
resins and specialty components are also used for composite applications. a structural composite is made by combining two or more different materials, such as fibers, resins and
other specialty additives, to create a product with enhanced structural properties. specifically, structural composites are lightweight, high-strength, rigid materials with high resistance
to chemicals, moisture and high temperatures. our product range comprises basic and advanced epoxy resins, curing agents and other advanced chemicals, additives and formulated polymer systems. the
four key target markets for our structural composites are aerospace, windmill blades for wind power generation, general industrial and automotive applications, and recreational products (mainly sports
equipment such as skis). structural composites continue to substitute for traditional materials, such as metals and wood, in a wide variety of applications due to their light weight, strength and
durability. 

formulated systems.    the structural adhesives market requires high-strength "engineering" adhesives for use in the manufacture and
repair
of items to bond various engineering substrates. our business focus is on engineering adhesives based on epoxy, polyurethane, acrylic and other technologies which are used to bond materials, such as
steel, aluminum, engineering plastics and composites in substitution of traditional joining techniques. our araldite® brand name has considerable value in the industrial and consumer
adhesives markets. in many countries, araldite® branded products are known for their high-performance adhesive capabilities, and we generally believe that this is the
value-added segment of the market where recognition of our long-standing araldite® brand is a key competitive advantage. packaging is a key characteristic of our adhesives
products. our range of adhesives is sold in a variety of packs and sizes, targeted to three specific end markets and sold through targeted routes to market: 



•general industrial bonding.  we sell a broad range of
advanced formulated adhesives to a broad base of small-to medium-sized customers, including specialty distributors.   
•industry specific.  we sell our adhesive products on a
global basis into diverse, industry-specific markets, which include the aerospace, wind turbine, lng transport, filter bonding, solar cell and other industrial application markets. our target markets
are chosen because we believe it is worthwhile to utilize our direct sales force and applications experts to tailor products and services to suit the needs and performance specifications of the
specific market segments.   
•consumer/diy.  we package and sell consumer adhesives
through strategic distribution arrangements with a number of the major marketers of consumer/diy adhesives, such as vynex, velcro and selleys. these products are sold globally through a number of
major retail outlets, often under the araldite® brand name. in india, our major diy business, we have direct access to the market and strong brand recognition which creates opportunity to
further expand our product offering as we leverage the value of the araldite® brand. 


our
electrical materials are formulated polymer systems, which make up the insulation materials used in equipment for the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical power,
such as transformers, switch gears, ignition coils, sensors, motors and magnets, and for the protection of electrical and electronic devices and components. the purpose of these products is to
insulate, protect or shield either the environment from electrical current or electrical devices from the environment, such as temperature or humidity. our electrical insulating materials target two
key market segments: the heavy electrical equipment market and the light electrical equipment market.

products
for the heavy electrical equipment market segment are used in power plant components, devices for power grids and insulating parts and components. in addition, there are
numerous devices, such as motors and magnetic coils used in trains and medical equipment, which are manufactured using epoxy and related technologies. products for the light electrical equipment
market segment are used in applications such as industrial automation and control, consumer electronics, automotive electronics and electrical components. the end customers in the electrical
insulating materials market encompass the relevant original equipment manufacturer ("oem") as well as numerous manufacturers of components used in the final products. we also develop, manufacture and
market materials used in the production of printed circuit boards. our products are ultimately used in industries ranging from telecommunications and personal computer mother board manufacture to
automotive electronic systems manufacture. soldermasks are our most important product line in printed circuit board technologies. sales are made mainly under the probimer®,
probimage® and probelec® trademarks. our probimer® trademark is a widely recognized brand name for soldermasks. 

sales and marketing  

we maintain multiple routes to market to service our diverse customer base. these routes to market range from using our own direct
sales force for targeted, technically-oriented distribution to mass general distribution. our direct sales force focuses on engineering solutions for decision-makers at major customers who purchase
significant amounts of product from us. we use technically-oriented specialist distributors to augment our sales effort in niche markets and applications where we do not believe it is appropriate to
develop direct sales resources. we use mass general distribution channels to sell our products into a wide range of general applications where technical expertise is less important to the user of the
products to reduce our overall selling expenses. we believe our use of multiple routes to market enables us to reach a broader customer base at an efficient cost. 

we
conduct sales activities through dedicated regional sales teams in the americas, europe, india, middle east, africa and asia. our global customers are covered by key account managers
who are familiar with the specific requirements of these clients. the management of long-standing customer relationships, some of which are 20 to 30 years old, is at the heart of
the sales and marketing process. we are also supported by a strong network of distributors. we serve a highly fragmented customer base. 

for
our consumer/diy range, we have entered into exclusive branding and distribution arrangements with, for example, selleys in australia. under these arrangements, our distribution
partners fund advertising and sales promotions, negotiate and sell to major retail chains, own inventories and provide store deliveries (and sometimes shelf merchandising) in exchange for a reliable,
high-quality supply of araldite® branded, ready-to-sell packaged products.

raw materials  

the principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol a and
blr. we also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives. raw material
costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts
contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased and formula-based pricing. 

additionally,
we produce some of our most important raw materials, such as blr and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products. we are among the
world's larger producers of blr. approximately 50% of the blr we produce is consumed in the production of our formulated polymer systems. the balance of our blr is sold as liquid or solid resin in the
merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our production plants and lower our overall blr production cost. we believe that manufacturing a substantial proportion of our principal raw
material gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based polymer systems formulators, most of whom must buy blr from third-party suppliers. this position helps protect us from pricing pressure
from blr suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of blr in difficult market conditions.

following:
consumer fashion apparel, sportswear, career and uniform apparel, military, automotive, home textiles and furnishings, carpet and other functional textiles. 

during
2011, our textile effects segment began implementing a significant restructuring program, including the closure of our production facilities and business support offices in basel,
switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the segment's long-term global competitiveness. in connection with this plan, during 2012, we recorded cash charges
of $1 million for workforce reductions, $9 million for decommissioning and other restructuring expenses, and noncash charges of $11 million primarily for pension settlements. we
expect to incur additional restructuring and plant closing charges of up to approximately $80 million through 2014 related to the closure of our production facilities and business support
offices in basel, switzerland. in addition, during 2012, our textile effects segment recorded charges of $4 million, of which $2 million related to the closure of our st. fons,
france facility and $2 million related to a global transfer pricing initiative. we reversed charges of $16 million which were no longer required for workforce reductions at our
production facility in langweid, germany, the simplification of the commercial organization and optimization of our distribution network, the consolidation of manufacturing activities and processes at
our site in basel, switzerland and the closure of our production facilities in basel, switzerland. 


products and markets  

textiles generally involve a complex matrix of fibers, effects and functionality, and the resulting products range from fashion apparel
to bulletproof vests, home linens to carpet, and upholstery to automotive interiors. our broad range of dyestuffs and chemicals enhance both the aesthetic appearance of these products and the
functionality needed to ensure that they perform in their end-use markets. since the requirements for these markets vary dramatically, our business strategy focuses on the two major
markets—apparel and technical textiles. we work to provide the right balance of products and service to meet the technical challenges in each of these markets. 


the
apparel market, which also includes our home interiors products, focuses on products that provide an aesthetic effect and/or improve the processing efficiency within the textile
mill. we offer a complete range of colors for cotton, polyester and nylon that cover the range of shades needed for sportswear, intimate apparel, towels, sheeting and casual wear. our dyes have been
developed to ensure that they offer the highest levels of wash fastness currently available in the market. optical brighteners and other pretreatment products provide "bright white" effects for
apparel, towels and sheeting. pretreatment and dyeing auxiliaries ensure that these fabrics are processed efficiently and
effectively—cleaning the fabrics with fewer chemicals, less energy and less water and thereby minimizing the environmental footprint and reducing the processing costs. silicone softeners
may be used to enhance the feel of products. 

technical
textiles include automotive textiles, carpet, military fabrics, mattress ticking and nonwoven and other technical fabrics. though the product groups may differ in their
end-uses, the articles must provide a high-level of functionality and performance in their respective markets. high-lightfast dyes and uv absorbers are used in
automotive interiors and outdoor furnishings to provide colors that don't fade when exposed to sunlight and heat. powerful stain repellent and release technology imparts durable protection for
upholstery, military and medical fabrics, without affecting the color, breathability or feel of the fabric. specialized dyes and prints create unique camouflage patterns for military uniforms,
backpacks and tarps that won't fade through wash and wear or during exposure to the elements. 

sales and marketing  

for our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. effect

raw materials  

the manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials (approximately 1,100 different chemicals),
including amines, fluorochemicals and sulfones. no one raw material represents greater than 4% of our textile effects raw material expenditures. raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of
sales for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the
quantities of product to be supplied and purchased and formula-based pricing. 


competition  

we are the leading global solutions provider for textile chemicals and dyes in our chosen markets. competition within the textile
chemicals and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who offer complete solutions for both markets. our major competitors are clariant, basf, kiri-dystar and longsheng.
we believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering, which is characterized by its broad range; high quality; significant integration between products and service; reliable
technical expertise; long-standing relationships with customers; and strong business

infrastructure
in asia. we believe that we have more customer service capability and account management capability than any of our competitors worldwide. 


pigments  

general  

we are a global leader in the creation of titanium dioxide solutions. titanium dioxide is a white inert pigment which provides
whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items including paints, plastics, paper, inks, food and personal care products. 

expertise
gained over 75 years combined with a pioneering spirit enable us to help our customers to succeed. we use our expertise in titanium dioxide to create solutions for our
customers that can deliver much more than whiteness and opacity including freeing capacity, reducing energy use and enabling infrastructure to last longer. our tioxide® and
deltio® brands are made in our seven manufacturing facilities around the globe and service over 1,200 customers in practically all industries and geographic regions. our global
manufacturing footprint allows us to service
both the needs of local and global customers, including ampacet, a. schulman, akzonobel, basf, clariant, jotun, polyone and ppg. 

our
pigments segment is focused on working with customers to create innovative solutions that will help them succeed and improving our competitive position. 

our
award winning altiris® pigment can increase the solar reflective properties in a wide range of colored exterior coatings. improving the solar reflectance of structures
can reduce the surface and interior temperatures of buildings resulting in lower energy consumption within these structures. in addition, in 2012 we approved the investment of approximately
$40 million at our scarlino, italy site to widen the range of feedstocks which the site could use and to produce value adding co-products, and in 2013 we expect to commission our
new magnesium sulfate fertilizer manufacturing operation at our calais, france site which will increase the efficiency, sustainability and cost effectiveness of the site. 

products and markets  

historically, global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global gdp growth rates. however, this varies by
region. developed markets such as the u.s. and western europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth
rates. the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end use markets. coating sales generally peak during the spring and
summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 

there
are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for
approximately 55% of global production capacity. most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that need pigment from a specific manufacturing
route—for example, the inks market requires sulfate and the automotive coatings market requires chloride. regional markets typically favor products that are available locally. 

our
company is one of the five major producers of titanium dioxide. beyond these producers, the titanium dioxide industry currently has a large number of small regional or local
producers, especially in china. titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks, efficiency
improvements and, more recently, new capacity additions in china. during periods of low titanium dioxide demand, the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to
manage working capital. pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply/demand balance. based upon current price levels and the 

24




 

table of contents

long
lead times for planning, governmental approvals and construction, we expect supply additions for the near term in line with historical demand growth. 

sales and marketing  

approximately 85% of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our global sales and technical services network, enabling us to work
closely with our customers. our focused sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium
dioxide. 

in
addition, we have focused on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. for example, we believe that our pigments business is
well-positioned to benefit from growth sectors where customers needs are complex resulting in fewer companies having the capability to support them. 

we
focus much of our research and development on solutions to address significant emerging trends in the market. this is evidenced by our deltio® pigments range which helps
our customers to liberate capacity, reduce energy, improve working environments and reduce waste. 

manufacturing and operations  


our pigments business has seven manufacturing sites operating in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately 565,000 metric
tons per year. approximately 72% of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in western europe.

table of contents 

joint venture  

louisiana pigment company, l.p. is our 50%-owned joint venture with kronos. we share production offtake and operating costs of
the plant with kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has
equal representation. our investment in louisiana pigment company, l.p. is accounted for using the equity method. 


raw materials  

the primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium bearing ores. historically, we have purchased the majority of
our ore under long-term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers. the majority of titanium bearing ores are sourced from australia, africa and canada. ore accounts for approximately
55% of pigment variable
manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 25% of our variable manufacturing costs. 

the
world market for titanium bearing ores has a small number of large suppliers (rio tinto, iluka and tronox) which account for approximately 50% of global supply and from which we
purchase approximately 60% of our needs. however, the choice of producers has increased in recent years with a number of emerging suppliers, and we have broadened our supply base by purchasing
increasing amounts of our ores from these suppliers. the titanium-bearing ores market is in the process of moving from long-term supply contracts with pricing formulas to
short-term contracts with market based prices. as a result of this shift we have seen a significant increase in our ore costs as our existing contracts expire. during 2012, we purchased
approximately 50% of our ore under existing long-term contracts and the remainder under new contracts. 

titanium
dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process. once an intermediate titanium dioxide
pigment has been produced, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. the finishing process is common to both the
sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product's performance characteristics. 

co-products
from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase
our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our pigments business. we sell over 50% of the co-products generated by our business. 


competition  

the global markets in which our pigments business operates are highly competitive. competition is based on the basis of price, product
quality and service. the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont, tronox, kronos and cristal, each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets. some
of our competitors may be able to produce products more economically than we can. in addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant
capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at
a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. moreover, the sulphate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments business is widely available.
accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in
circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing.

research and development  

for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we spent $152 million, $166 million and $151 million,
respectively, on research and development. 

we
support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. our research and development centers are located in
the woodlands, texas; everberg, belgium; and shanghai, china. other regional development/technical service centers are located in billingham, england (pigments); auburn hills, michigan (polyurethanes
for the automotive industry); derry, new hampshire, shanghai, china, deggendorf, germany and ternate, italy (polyurethanes); melbourne, australia (surfactants); port neches, texas (process engineering
support); basel, switzerland and panyu, china (advanced materials and textile effects); and mumbai, india (textile effects). 

intellectual property rights  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. we own
approximately 440 unexpired u.s. patents, approximately 160 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending at the u.s. patent and trademark office, and approximately 3,650 foreign
counterparts, including both issued patents and pending patent applications. while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued u.s. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will
not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents
will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our
ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 

we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. there can
be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or
proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized
use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. in addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or
other access by legal means. 

in
addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements
authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. we also have licensed or
sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties. 

we
have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 134 u.s. trademark registrations (including applications for registration currently pending at the
u.s. patent and trademark office), and approximately 4,610 foreign counterparts, including both registrations and applications for registration. some of these registrations and applications include
filings under the madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. however, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will
provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. 

because
of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for
which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next
several years, either

individually
or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

employees  

as of december 31, 2012, we employed approximately 12,000 people in our operations around the world. approximately 2,000 of
these employees are located in the u.s., while approximately 10,000 are located in other countries. we believe our relations with our employees are good. 

geographic data  

for sales revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see "note 27. operating segment information" to our
consolidated financial statements. 


environmental, health and safety matters  

general  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety,
pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
waste materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in
addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws,
environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some
environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to
modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. 

environmental, health and safety systems  

we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety ("ehs") legal
requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with
applicable legal requirements, ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and
emission of wastes and other pollutants. although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in
our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 

ehs capital expenditures  

we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and
repair pollution control equipment. for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled $105 million, $92 million, and
$85 million, respectively. because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of
specific requirements, our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future
amounts we may spend related to ehs and other applicable laws.

remediation liabilities  

we have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former
facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the
purchase of our businesses. under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 


under
the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable
for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless
of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. outside the u.s., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in france and australia, can hold past owners
and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. currently, there are approximately 10 former facilities or third-party sites in the u.s. for which we have been notified of potential
claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed under cercla. based on
current information and past experiences at other cercla sites, we do not expect these third-party claims to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

one
of these sites, the north maybe canyon mine site, involves a former phosphorous mine near soda springs, idaho, which is believed to have been operated by a predecessor company. in
2004, the u.s. forest service notified us that we are a cercla potentially responsible party ("prp") for contaminated surface water at the site. in february 2010, we and wells cargo (another prp)
agreed to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study of a portion of the site and are currently engaged in that process. at this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate our potential
liabilities at this site. 

in
addition, under the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a
condition to our hazardous waste permit. some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. we are
aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. for example, our port neches, texas, and
geismar, louisiana, facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements imposed under rcra. similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously
operated, manufacturing facilities, such as australia, india, france, hungary and italy. 

by
letter dated march 7, 2006, our former base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray, australia, was issued a clean-up notice by the environmental
protection authority victoria ("epa victoria") due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. on august 23, 2010, epa victoria revoked the second
clean-up notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation. we have reached agreement with the agency that a mortgage on the land
will be held by the agency as financial surety during the period covered by the current clean-up notice, which ends on july 30, 2014. as of december 31, 2012, we had an
accrued liability of $29 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site. we can provide no assurance that the agency will not seek to institute additional
requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be associated with the clean up. 

environmental reserves  

we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known
penalties. liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimates are calculated using present value
techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon

us
by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. the environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations. we had accrued
$34 million and $36 million for environmental liabilities as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. of these amounts, $10 million and $7 million were
classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $24 million and $29 million were classified as other
noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. in certain cases, our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to
30 years. we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess. 

regulatory developments  

the eu regulatory framework for chemicals, called "reach", became effective in 2007 and is designed to be phased in gradually over
11 years. as a reach-regulated company that manufactures in or imports more than one metric ton per year of a chemical substance into the european economic area, we were required to
pre-register with the european chemicals agency ("echa"), such chemical substances and isolated intermediates to take advantage of the 11 year phase-in period. to meet
our compliance obligations, a cross-business reach team was established, through which we were able to fulfill all required pre-registrations and our first phase registrations by the
november 30, 2010 deadline. while we continue our registration efforts to meet the next registration deadline of may 31, 2013, our reach implementation team is now strategically focused
on the authorization phase of the reach process, directing its efforts to address "substances of very high concern" and evaluating potential business implications. where warranted, evaluation of
substitute chemicals will be an important element of our ongoing manufacturing sustainability efforts. as a chemical manufacturer with global operations, we are also actively monitoring and addressing
analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the eu, for example, in korea and taiwan. 

although
the total long-term cost for reach compliance is unknown at this time, we spent approximately $8 million, $5 million and $9 million in 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively, to meet the initial reach requirements. we cannot provide assurance that these recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts that we may be required to spend for
reach compliance. 

greenhouse gas regulation  

globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of "greenhouse gases" ("ghgs"), such as
carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the most recent negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol, a limited group of
nations, including the european union ("eu"), agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly,
the european union ghg emissions trading system, established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the eu, has just entered its third phase and ongoing reforms at the eu
level—including measures to prop up carbon credit prices and ban the use of certain types of certified emission reductions—may increase our operating costs. australia has also
adopted a carbon trading system that has been recognized for formal linkage with the eu trading system by 2018. australia's ghg cap-and-trade program may impose compliance
obligations upon our operations that may increase our operating costs. in the united states, california has commenced the first compliance period of its cap-and-trade program. 

federal
climate change legislation in the united states appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will be led by the
environmental protection agency's (the "epa") ghg regulations and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased
capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities

may
be subject to the clean air act's prevention of significant deterioration requirements under the epa's ghg "tailoring rule." our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of
greenhouse gases rule, and the collection and reporting of ghg data may increase our operational costs. 


under
a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the environmental protection agency is due to propose new source performance standards (nsps) for ghg emissions from
refineries. these standards could significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products.
either of these events could have an adverse effect on our business. 

we
are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and/or eu emissions trading
scheme requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible
that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and/or increases in
energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on
any of our sites. 

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical
effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and
operations. 

port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the u.s.
department of justice (the "doj") notified us that we were in violation of the clean air act ("cca") based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the
enforcement initiative to bring similar actions against refiners and other chemical manufacturers. specifically, the epa alleged violations of flare operations at our port neches, texas facility from
2007-2012 against us that were not consistent with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these findings, epa referred
this matter to the doj. we have been engaged in discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these violations and are in the process of reviewing their allegations and assessing their claims. we are
currently unable to determine the likelihood or magnitude of potential penalty or injunctive relief that may be incurred in resolving this matter. 

available information  

we maintain an internet website at http://www.huntsman.com. our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on
form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we
file this material with the sec. we also provide electronic or paper copies of our sec filings free of charge upon request.

item 1a.    risk factors        


any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

risks related to our business  

our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile economic conditions.  

our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the u.s., europe and asia. declining economic
conditions in all or any of these locations—or negative perceptions about economic conditions—could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could
adversely affect our business. in particular, our operations in europe continue to be impacted by the uncertain european economy. while we currently anticipate that, in the aggregate, our business in
europe will grow slowly, a currency or financial crisis in europe could precipitate a significant decline in the european economy, which would likely result in a decrease in demand for our products in
europe. 

uncertain
economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market
conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. as a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on
our financial condition or results of operations. we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry. 

the markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products.  

historically, the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and profit
margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins. the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes
in the supply and demand for products, changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world. for example, demand for our products depends in part on the housing
and construction industries. these industries are cyclical in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy. the cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in
significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle. 

disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities, both planned and unplanned, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial
condition.  

manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds and outages. unplanned
production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or
internal reasons, such as fire,
unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase
production or qualify with our customers, each of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. long-term production disruptions may cause
our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability. 

33




 

table of contents

our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes.  

we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the u.s., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with
international operations. these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could
result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. in addition, we translate our local currency financial results into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during
the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local
currency may translate into fewer u.s. dollars. because we currently have significant operations located outside the u.s., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in
gains or losses on our financial statements. 

other
risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and
required compliance with a variety of u.s. and foreign laws, including tax laws, the foreign corrupt practices act (and foreign equivalents), export controls and ofac regulations. in addition,
although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material
monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from
country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables
through foreign legal systems. the occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability to make
distributions to us. 

we
operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the
jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. in addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap" or "u.s. gaap") has required us to place valuation
allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions. these valuation
allowances result from analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in
specific tax jurisdictions. changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of the current
valuation allowances and potentially the establishment of new valuation allowances. while significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant
fluctuations. 

if we are unable to execute our cost reduction plans successfully, our total operating costs may be greater than expected, which may adversely affect our profitability.  

we have commenced a number of actions to restructure our polyurethanes, textile effects and advanced materials segments to improve our
earnings profile. we are in the process of implementing these programs and have realized a portion of the anticipated benefits. while we continue to search for opportunities to reduce our costs and
expenses to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the effectiveness of our operations, our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions
depends upon a number of factors. if we do not successfully execute on our cost reduction initiatives or if we experience delays in completing the implementation of these initiatives, our results of
operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. 

34




 

table of contents

our efforts to grow our businesses may require significant investments; if our growth strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial
condition may be materially adversely affected.  

we continuously evaluate growth opportunities. our growth initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and
joint ventures, and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant investment. we have incurred indebtedness to finance growth initiatives, and we may incur additional
indebtedness to finance future growth initiatives. we could also issue additional shares of stock to finance such initiatives. if our growth strategies are not successful, we could face increased
financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets. 

in
addition, the implementation of growth strategies may create additional risks, including:



•diversion of management focus away from existing operations; 
•impairment of the operation of our business due to capital or equity commitments;  
•inability to accurately predict the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or new facilities;  
•inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses;  
•disruptions to important business relationships; 
•increased operating costs; 
•difficulties in realizing projected synergies; 
•exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including for illegal activities conducted by an acquired company or a joint
venture partner; and 
•usage of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants. 


all
of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could
reduce our profitability.  

the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile. we purchase a substantial portion of our
raw materials from third-party suppliers. the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow
price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. 

in
general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic commodity products that are readily available at market prices. however, ore feedstocks for our pigments segment
are periodically in short supply. we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, but disruptions of existing supply arrangements or expiration of favorable supply contracts
could substantially impact our profitability. if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the
necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. in addition, if raw materials become
unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes. any interruption in the supply of raw materials could
increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. 

35




 


table of contents

our
supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. while we attempt to match cost increases with
corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract
product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. any cost increase that we are not able to pass on
to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

financial difficulties and related problems at our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

during periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies,
restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability. a significant adverse
change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that
customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. in addition, we rely on a number of vendors and suppliers and collaborations with other industry
participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities, that we need to operate our business. during periods of
economic disruption, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. if this were to occur, it could adversely affect
their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products.
moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. all of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

the industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and
major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our leadership position in various
products and markets throughout the world. in addition, some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. furthermore, some of our competitors
have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. some of our competitors are owned or
partially owned by foreign governments which may provide a competitive advantage to those competitors. while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and
processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us
less competitive. moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be
rendered uneconomical or obsolete. further, it is possible we could be named in future litigation for the infringement or misappropriation of a competitor's or other third party's intellectual
property rights, which could include a claim for injunctive relief and damages, and, if so, that adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position. 

36




 

table of contents

in
addition, certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of
our business, and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is
increasing. further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future. increased
competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

our significant debt level, a portion of which is subject to variable interest rates, makes us vulnerable to downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market
conditions or to obtain additional financing.  

we have significant outstanding debt: as of december 31, 2012, our total consolidated outstanding debt was approximately
$3,702 million (including current portion of debt); our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 66%; our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately
$2.1 billion; and our current portion of debt totaled approximately $288 million. our debt level, and the fact that a significant percentage of our cash flow is required to make payments
on our debt, could have important consequences for our business, including but not limited to the following:



•we may be more vulnerable to business, industry or economic downturns, making it more difficult to respond to market
conditions; 
•cash flow available for other purposes, including the growth of our business, may be reduced;  
•our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained, particularly during periods when the capital markets are
unsettled; 
•our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us; and  
•part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates (for
example, a 1% increase in interest rates, without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items, would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $21 million). 


our
debt level also impacts our credit ratings. any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could
result in increased interest and other costs. 

agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or to obtain additional financing.  

the agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants. these covenants may limit or prohibit our ability
to incur more debt; make certain prepayments of debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; issue stock; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates;
enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. 

our
failure to comply with any of our debt covenants, or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt, could result in a default, or trigger cross-default or
acceleration provisions, under our debt agreements. an event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, cause our creditors to terminate their lending
commitments, or force us or one or more of our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. for

natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses.  

any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane, fire, earthquake, flood or any other natural or man-made
disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at
any of these facilities, it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results. in addition, many of our current and potential customers are
concentrated in specific geographic areas including the u.s. gulf coast, which is subject to hurricanes. a disaster in one of these regions could have a material impact on our operations, operating
results and financial condition. 

while
we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances
that our plans would fully protect us from all such disasters or events that might result due to climate change. in addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us from any losses incurred as a
result of natural or other disasters. furthermore, in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not available at all. 

our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability.  

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject
to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical products. these hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or
hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. we are also potentially subject to other
hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor
difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental
damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace
exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters. 

we
maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance
policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. each of these
insurance policies is subject to
customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies
can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we
were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 


in
addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. for more information, see
"—item 3. legal proceedings—antitrust matters" below. it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured
or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. 

38




 

table of contents

our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims against us, including antitrust claims.  

we face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property and
environmental claims. over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies, and we have been named as a defendant in the antitrust suits discussed in
"—item 3. legal proceedings—antitrust matters" below. in this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, which may be significant. an adverse
outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

we are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection
of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. actual or
alleged violations of environmental, health and safety or ehs, laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions,
as well as, under some ehs laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. 

governmental,
regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory
control with respect to the chemical industry. in addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our reputation,
the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. moreover, changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our
facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. 

we
could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws. capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory
requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently
anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws. 

furthermore,
we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed
of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. we may therefore incur additional costs and
expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws. 

we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems could materially
affect our operations.  

we rely on information technology systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain and financial information and
various other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. information technology system failures,
network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders or impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of
transactions or reporting of financial results. an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential
information concerning our customers or employees, which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation.

table of contents

we
have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information,
or disruption of our operations. current employees have, and former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our
competitors or otherwise used to harm us. moreover, our operations in certain locations, such as china, may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems. any breach of our security
measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information, corruption of data or disruption of operations or transactions, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business. 

in
addition, we could be required to expend significant additional amounts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches. we
may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the significant risks to our information technology systems. 

regulatory or market changes with respect to mtbe may materially reduce our sales and/or materially increase our costs.  


we produce mtbe, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of
gasoline. because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the u.s. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the u.s. market. we currently
market mtbe, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the u.s. this business has been profitable to us over time, and future legislative or regulatory
initiatives outside the u.s. restricting mtbe could materially adversely affect our ability to market and sell mtbe and our profitability. we have recently announced a joint venture with sinopec
involving the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china, which will further expose us to these risks. 


while
we could use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe, this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities.
moreover, the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe. 

our business is dependent on our intellectual property. if our intellectual property rights cannot be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our
ability to compete may be adversely affected.  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. while a presumption of validity
exists with respect to patents issued to us in the u.s., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated,
circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide
meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then our ability to compete may be adversely affected. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or
preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity. 

we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. while it
is our policy to enter into agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be
breached, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or
disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how. 

40




 

table of contents

in
addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 


we
may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation
or infringement in countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to
the same extent as u.s. law. 

the
failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or the failure of adequate
legal remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business.  

we depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management. if any of these
individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced, our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be
materially disrupted. we generally do not
have employment agreements with, and we do not maintain any "key person" life insurance for, any of our executive officers. 

conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability, in particular in certain energy-producing nations, along with increased security regulations related
to our industry, could adversely affect our business.  

conflicts, military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in financial markets. instability
and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases. the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of
terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers. accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our
suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
addition, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result
in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 

if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make payment on our debts.  


our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries. because a significant portion
of our operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of
such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries. any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or
advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign
currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our nonguarantor subsidiaries. in
addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings. 

our
subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any
funds 

41




 


table of contents

available
for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. any right that we have to receive
any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the
sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary. 

regulatory requirements to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  


globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or ghgs, such as
carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the most recent negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol, a limited group of
nations, including the eu, agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the european union
ghg emissions trading system, established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the eu, has just entered its third phase and ongoing reforms at the eu level—including
measures to prop up carbon credit prices and ban the use of certain types of certified emission reductions—may increase our operating costs. australia has also adopted a carbon trading
system that has been recognized for formal linkage with the eu trading system by 2018. australia's ghg cap-and-trade program may impose compliance obligations upon our
operations that may increase our operating costs. in the united states, california has commenced the first compliance period of its cap-and-trade program. 

federal
climate change legislation in the united states appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will be led by the epa's ghg
regulations and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or
expanded facilities. expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act's prevention of significant deterioration requirements under the epa's
ghg "tailoring rule." our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and the collection and reporting of ghg data may increase our operational costs. 

under
a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the epa is due to propose new source performance standards (nsps) for ghg emissions from refineries. these standards could
significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. either of these events could have an
adverse effect on our business. 

we
are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and/or eu emissions trading
scheme requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible
that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital costs to modify operations as necessary to meet ghg emission limits and/or additional
in energy costs, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant
physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our
facilities and operations.

risks related to our common stock and debt securities  


our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations.  

we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so. the
trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues, including broad market factors that may have a material adverse
impact on our stock price, regardless of actual performance. the following factors could affect our stock price:



•periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors;  
•downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of
our competitors; 
•material announcements by us or our competitors; 
•public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock; and  
•adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we
operate. 


shares available for future sale may cause our common stock price to decline, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.  

sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause
prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock to decline. 

we have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock.  

the issuance of additional equity securities would result in dilution of then-existing stockholders' equity interests in
our company. our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine, with respect to any
series of preferred stock, the number of shares in that series and the terms, rights and limitations of that series. if we issue convertible notes or convertible preferred stock, a subsequent
conversion may dilute the current common stockholders' interest. our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such
convertible instruments, but reserves the right to do so in the future. in addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans. 


certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of
control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value.  

certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as a classified board of directors, limitations on
stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire control of our company, even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial. our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue
preferred stock without stockholder approval. therefore, our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for
a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value.

table of contents

the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under delaware law, and there can be no assurance that we
will continue to pay dividends.  

over the past four years we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock. the declaration of dividends by our company is subject
to the discretion of our board of directors. our board of directors takes into account such matters as general business conditions, our financial results, expected liquidity and capital expenditure
requirements, contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant, and we can
provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. in addition, delaware law contains certain restrictions on a company's ability to pay cash dividends and we can provide
no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods. 

jon m. huntsman, our executive chairman and founder, may be deemed to control approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock and he may have the ability to substantially
impact the outcome of matters voted on by our stockholders.  


jon m. huntsman, our executive chairman and founder, may be deemed to control approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock.
through his interests, he may have the ability to substantially impact:



•the election of the members of the board of directors of our company; 
•the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including amendments to our certificate of
incorporation, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; and 
•any potential change in control of our company. 


we may purchase a portion of our debt securities, which could impact the market for our debt securities and likely would negatively affect our liquidity.  

during 2012, we redeemed certain of our debt securities. we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem more of our debt
securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full call for redemption or otherwise. any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount
thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. such transactions could negatively affect our liquidity.

item 3.   legal proceedings        

asbestos litigation  

we have been named as a "premises defendant" in a number of asbestos exposure cases, typically claims by nonemployees of exposure to
asbestos while at a facility. in the past, these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants, and the complaints have not indicated which plaintiffs
were making claims against which defendants, where or how the alleged injuries occurred or what injuries each plaintiff claimed. these facts, which would be central to any estimate of probable loss,
generally have been learned only through discovery. 

where
a claimant's alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership of the relevant "premises," the prior owners generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for, and to
indemnify us against, asbestos exposure claims. this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations. upon service of a complaint in one of these cases, we tender it to the
prior owner. rarely do the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought. the prior owner accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any
amounts due to the claimants. in our nineteen-year experience with tendering these cases, we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases. we believe that the
prior owners have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnity obligations, although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these
cases if they do not. 

the
following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about cases for which service has been received that we have tendered to the prior owner, all of which have
been accepted.

(1)although
the indemnifying party informs us when tendered cases have been resolved, it generally does not inform us of the settlement amounts relating to
such cases, if any. the indemnifying party has informed us that it typically manages our defense together with the defense of other entities in such cases and resolves claims involving multiple
defendants simultaneously, and that it considers the allocation of settlement amounts, if any, among defendants to be confidential and proprietary. consequently, we are not able to provide the number
of cases resolved with payment by the indemnifying party or the amount of such payments.

table of contents

we
have never made any payments with respect to these cases. as of december 31, 2012, we had an accrued liability of approximately $10 million relating to these cases and a
corresponding receivable of approximately $10 million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases. we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or
that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; accordingly, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of
loss in excess of our accruals. additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future, and such claims could be material. however, because we are not able to estimate the amount or
range of losses associated with such claims, we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december 31, 2012. 

certain
cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators. however, we may be entitled to insurance or other recoveries in some
of these cases. the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about these cases. cases include all cases for which service has been received by us. certain prior cases
that were filed in error against us have been dismissed.

2011 and 2010, respectively. as of december 31, 2012, we had no accrual relating to these cases. we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability
associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; accordingly, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our
accruals. additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future, and such claims could be material. however, because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses
associated with such claims, we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december 31, 2012. 

antitrust matters  

we have been named as a defendant in two class action civil antitrust suits filed on february 9 and 12, 2010 in the u.s.
district court for the district of maryland alleging that we and our co-defendants and other co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the u.s.
between at least march 1, 2002 and the present. the suits were subsequently consolidated. the other defendants named in this matter are dupont, kronos and millennium. on august 28, 2012,
the court certified a class consisting of all u.s. customers who purchased titanium dioxide directly from defendants since february 1, 2003, and notice was given to putative class members the
week of january 14, 2013 after the court of appeals for the fourth circuit denied our petition to appeal the order certifying the class. trial is set to begin september 9, 2013. 

the
plaintiffs seek to recover on behalf of the class injunctive relief, treble damages, costs of suit and attorneys fees. we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our
employees. nevertheless, we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts material to us. because of the overall complexity of these cases, we are unable to
reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss with respect to these claims.

we indemnify them for claims brought by certain matlinpatterson entities that were formerly our shareholders, the plaintiffs, in litigation filed june 19, 2012 in the 9th district court
in montgomery county, texas. the banks assert that they are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the agreement of compromise and settlement between the banks and our company, dated june 22,
2009, wherein the banks and our company settled claims that we brought relating to the failed merger with hexion. the plaintiffs claim that the banks knowingly made materially false representations
about the nature of the financing for the acquisition of our company by hexion and that they suffered substantial losses to their 19 million shares of our common stock as a result of the banks'
misrepresentations. the plaintiffs are asserting statutory fraud, common law fraud and aiding and abetting statutory fraud and are seeking actual damages, exemplary damages, costs and attorney's fees,
pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. we denied the banks' indemnification demand. on december 21, 2012, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. the
plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration and could still appeal the court's dismissal of their claims. 

environmental enforcement proceedings  

on occasion, we receive notices of violation, enforcement or other complaints from regulatory agencies alleging noncompliance with
applicable ehs laws. based on currently available information and our past experience, we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened environmental enforcement proceedings will
have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the doj
notified us that we were in violation of the caa based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the enforcement initiative to bring similar actions
against refiners and other chemical manufacturers. specifically, the epa alleged violations of flare operations at our port neches, texas facility from 2007-2012 that were not consistent
with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these findings, the epa referred this matter to the doj. we have been engaged in
discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these violations and are in the process of reviewing their allegations and assessing their claims. we are currently unable to determine the likelihood or
magnitude of potential penalty or injunctive relief that may be incurred in resolving this matter. 

other proceedings  

we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under
provisions of applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these
matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

(b)(loss)
income from discontinued operations represents the operating results, fire insurance settlement gains and loss on disposal of our former australian
styrenics business, our former u.s. base chemicals business, our former north american polymers business, our former european base chemicals and polymers business and our former tdi business. the u.s.
base chemicals business was sold on november 5, 2007, the north american polymers business was sold on august 1, 2007, the european base chemicals and polymers business was sold on
december 29, 2006 and the tdi business was sold on july 6, 2005. see "note 25. discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements.
(c)the
extraordinary gain (loss) on the acquisition of a business relates to the june 30, 2006 acquisition of our textile effects business. see
"note 3. business combinations and dispositions—textile effects acquisition" to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
  
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations        

overview  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our products comprise a
broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those
in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings,
power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, epoxy-based
polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide. our administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the
facilities listed in "part i. item 2. properties" above, which are located in 30 countries. we employed approximately 12,000 associates worldwide at december 31, 2012. 


we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and
textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products. in a series of transactions beginning in 2006, we have sold or
shutdown substantially all of our former australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations. we report the results from these businesses as discontinued
operations. see "note 25. discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements. 

growth
in our polyurethanes and advanced materials segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications, as
well as by the level of global economic activity. historically, demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth. in polyurethanes, this growth, driven largely by asia, has
in recent years resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products, including mdi. 

in
our performance products segment, demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp as overall demand is significantly influenced by new
product and application development. demand for most of our performance intermediates has grown in line with gdp growth. over time, demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that
slightly exceed gdp growth. however, given its dependence on the upr market, which is influenced by construction end markets, maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical. 


demand
in our textile effects segment is driven primarily by consumer activity. consumer spending for goods incorporating our textile effects products is impacted significantly by a wide
range of economic factors, including personal incomes, housing and energy prices and other highly volatile 

57




 

table of contents

factors.
accordingly, demand for our textile effects products has been volatile and appears likely to remain volatile. 


historically,
demand for titanium dioxide pigments has grown at rates approximately equal to global gdp growth. pigment prices have historically reflected industry-wide
operating rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers, contract arrangements
and seasonality. the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints, the largest end use for titanium dioxide, generally peak during the spring and summer months in the
northern hemisphere. this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year. during 2012, we have benefited from certain ore supply contracts in our pigments segment that
effectively supplied approximately 50% of our ore requirements at prices close to 2011 market levels, which are significantly below current market prices. a majority of these contracts expired at the
end of 2012, with the resulting benefits reflected through most of the first quarter of 2013. 

for
further information regarding sales price and demand trends, see "results of operations—segment analysis—year ended december 31, 2012 compared to year
ended december 31, 2011" and the tables captioned "year ended december 31, 2012 vs. 2011, period-over-period increase (decrease)" and "fourth quarter 2012 vs.
third quarter 2012, period-over-period increase (decrease)" below. 

outlook  

we experienced strong growth in our polyurethanes segment, particularly in our mdi business, and anticipate favorable market conditions
in the future. while the factors we describe below are subject to general economic conditions, we expect our pigments segment to continue going through a business cycle with improvements beginning in
the second half of 2013. we anticipate that the future benefits from our ongoing restructuring and cost cutting efforts will result in a lower cost structure and more competitive business when
complete in the middle of 2014. 

the
following summarizes trends and key considerations that could impact future performance of our operating segments: 

polyurethanes: 



•improving mdi demand 
•restructuring benefit 
•continued strong demand for mtbe 
•2013 ebitda similar to 2012 


performance products: 



•u.s. gulf coast raw material cost advantage 
•further recovery in amines margins 
•planned periodic maintenance in the first quarter of 2013 
•2013 ebitda similar to 2012 


advanced materials: 



•restructuring benefit 
•2013 ebitda better than 2012 

58




 

table of contents

textile effects: 



•reorganization and restructuring benefit 
•2013 ebitda positive 


pigments: 



•favorable ilmenite raw material advantage versus traditional chloride ores  
•improving contribution margins in the second half of 2013 
•near term contribution margin pressure 
•2013 ebitda less than 2012 


we
expect to spend approximately $450 million in 2013 on capital expenditures, net of reimbursements, for growth initiatives and maintenance. 

we
expect our full year 2013 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 35% primarily due to the effect of the tax valuation allowances and expected regional mix of income. we
believe our long-term effective income tax rate will be approximately 30% to 35%.

nm—not meaningful 


(1)ebitda
is defined as net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, before interest, income taxes, depreciation
and amortization. we believe that ebitda supplements an investor's understanding of our financial performance. however, ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net
income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, or other measures of performance as defined by gaap. moreover, ebitda as used herein is not necessarily
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. our management uses ebitda to assess financial performance by reviewing
ebitda as a general indicator of economic performance compared with prior periods. because ebitda excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, ebitda provides an indicator of
general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings, fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, or levels of depreciation and amortization. accordingly, our management
believes this type of measurement is useful for 
61




 

table of contents



comparing
general operating performance from period to period and making certain related management decisions. ebitda is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of
different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. for example, interest expense can be highly
dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. in addition, the tax positions
of
companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. as a result, effective tax
rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. this
can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. nevertheless, our management recognizes that there are
material limitations associated with the use of ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, which
reflects overall financial performance, including the effects of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. ebitda excludes interest expense. because we have borrowed money in order to
finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations. ebitda
also excludes taxes. because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations, any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations. finally, ebitda excludes depreciation and
amortization expense. because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. therefore, any measure that excludes
depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations. our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda by using it to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete
understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than gaap results alone. our management also uses other metrics to evaluate capital structure, tax planning and capital investment
decisions. for example, our management uses credit ratings and net debt ratios to evaluate capital structure, effective tax rate by jurisdiction to evaluate tax planning, and payback period and
internal rate of return to evaluate capital investments. our management also uses trade working capital to evaluate its investment in accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable. 

adjusted
ebitda is computed by eliminating the following from ebitda: loss on early extinguishment of debt; certain legal settlements and related expenses; ebitda from discontinued operations;
acquisition expenses; expenses associated with the terminated merger and related litigation (huntsman corporation only); gain on disposition of businesses/assets; extraordinary (gain) loss on the
acquisition of a business; loss (gain) on initial consolidation of subsidiaries; and restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs (credits).  


adjusted
ebitda is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to ebitda and reported gaap measures because we believe that it is indicative of our operating performance and is frequently used as a
valuation measure of chemical companies. our management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate the core operating performance of our segments and business.  

in
addition to the limitations of ebitda noted above, adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe
it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods for the following reasons: certain excluded items can vary significantly
depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to current operating results or trends; and certain excluded items, while
potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results.

table of contents



adjusted
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income applicable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, as an indicator of performance, or as any other
measure determined in accordance with gaap.  

we
believe that net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most
directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda.  

for
each of our company and huntsman international, the following tables set forth certain items of (income) expense included in ebitda (in millions):

(2)adjusted
net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income applicable to huntsman corporation
or huntsman international, as appropriate: (a) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (b) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (c) discount amortization on settlement
financing; (d) loss (income) from discontinued operations; (e) acquisition expenses; (f) expenses associated with the terminated merger and related litigation (huntsman
corporation only); (g) gain on disposition of businesses/assets; (h) extraordinary (gain) loss on the acquisition of a business; (i) loss (gain) on initial consolidation of
subsidiaries; and (j) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. the income tax impacts of each adjusting item is calculated using the statutory rates in the applicable
taxing jurisdiction and considering valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. we do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides
more meaningful information than is provided under gaap. basic adjusted income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. diluted net income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities.  


adjusted
net income and adjusted income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental disclosures to net income applicable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate,
and income per share because we believe that these measures are indicative of our operating performance. adjusted net income and adjusted income per share exclude items that may be recurring in nature
and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to
other periods for the following reasons: certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate
specifically to current operating results or trends; and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results.

year ended december 31, 2012 compared with year ended december 31, 2011  

for the year ended december 31, 2012, net income attributable to huntsman corporation was $363 million on revenues of
$11,187 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman corporation of $247 million on revenues of $11,221 million for 2011. for the year ended december 31,
2012, net income attributable to huntsman international was $365 million on revenues of $11,187 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman international of
$253 million on revenues of $11,221 million for 2011. the increase of $116 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the increase of $112 million in
net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



•revenues for 2012 decreased by $34 million, or less than one percent, as compared with 2011. the decrease was due
principally to lower average selling prices in our performance products and advanced materials segments and lower sales volumes in our performance products and pigments segments, offset by higher
average selling prices in our polyurethanes and pigments segments and higher sales volumes in our polyurethanes, advanced materials and textile effects segments. see "—segment analysis"
below. 
•our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for 2012 increased by $194 million and
$183 million, or 11% and 10%, respectively, as compared with 2011. the increase resulted from higher gross margins in our polyurethanes and textile effects segments, offset in part by lower
margins in our other segments. see "—segment analysis" below. 
•our operating expenses and the operating expenses of huntsman international for 2012 increased by $30 million and
$18 million, or 3% and 2%, respectively, as compared with 2011. increases in operating expenses in 2012 were primarily due to a $4 million loss recognized in 2012 in connection with the
russian systems house acquisition, a $34 million gain recognized in 2011 on the sale of our stereolithography resin and digitalis® machine manufacturing businesses and a
$12 million gain on the consolidation of our sasol-huntsman joint venture recognized in 2011, offset in part by decreases in operating expenses primarily due to the impact of translating
foreign currency amounts to the u.s. dollar and a $35 million decrease in costs related to legal claims in 2012. 
•restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for 2012 decreased to $92 million from $167 million in
2011. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.  
•our net interest expense and the net interest expense of huntsman international for 2012 decreased by $23 million
and $24 million, respectively, or 9% each, as compared with 2011. the decrease is due principally to lower average debt balances. 
•our loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2012 increased to $80 million from $7 million in 2011 as a
result of higher net repayments of indebtedness in 2012 as compared to 2011. in 2012, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $78 million primarily from the repurchase of a
portion of our 5.50% senior notes due 2016 ("2016 senior notes"). for more information, see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on
early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 
•our income tax expense increased by $60 million to an expense of $169 million for 2012 as compared with an
expense of $109 million for 2011. huntsman international's income tax expense increased by $66 million to an expense of $179 million for 2012 as compared with an expense of
$113 million for 2011. our and huntsman international's tax obligations are affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. our and huntsman
international's increase in tax expense was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings. for more information concerning income taxes, see "note 18. income taxes" to our consolidated
financial statements.
•our loss from discontinued operations for 2012 increased to $7 million from $1 million in 2011. for more
information, see "note 25. discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the increase in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2012 compared to 2011 was due to higher sales volumes and higher average
selling prices, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar against the euro. mdi sales volumes increased as a result of improved demand in all regions and across most major markets. po/mtbe
sales volumes increased due to strong demand. mdi average selling prices increased in all regions, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar against the euro. po/mtbe average selling prices
increased primarily due to favorable market conditions. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher margins and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher restructuring,
impairment and plant closing costs. during 2012 and 2011, our polyurethanes segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $38 million and nil, respectively. for more
information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 

performance products  

the decrease in revenues in our performance products segment for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower average selling
prices and lower sales volumes. average selling prices decreased across almost all businesses primarily in response to lower raw material costs and the strength of the u.s. dollar against major
international currencies. sales volumes decreased primarily due to a shift to

arrangements. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher operating expenses. in addition, in 2011 we recorded a gain of $12 million in connection
with the consolidation of our sasol-huntsman joint venture. 

advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower average selling prices,
partially offset by higher sales
volumes. average selling prices decreased in all regions and across most markets in response to competitive market pressure, lower raw material costs in most regions and the strength of the u.s.
dollar against major international currencies. sales volumes increased across most regions, primarily due to stronger global demand in our base resins business, while sales volumes in the
asia-pacific region decreased due to lower demand in the wind energy, electrical engineering and electronics markets. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher
restructuring and impairment costs and lower margins due in part to the change in sales mix from increased base resin sales volumes, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs
as a result of recent restructuring efforts. during 2012 and 2011, our advanced materials segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $38 million and
$20 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial
statements. 

textile effects  

the increase in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially
offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar against major international currencies. sales volumes increased due to increased market share in key markets. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due
to lower restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs and lower manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs as a result of recent restructuring efforts, partially
offset by lower margins. during 2012 and 2011, our textile effects segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $9 million and $135 million, respectively, and
expenses for the transition of production from basel, switzerland to a tolling facility of $17 million and nil, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see
"note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 

pigments  

the decrease in revenues in our pigments segment for 2012 compared to 2011 was due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher
average selling prices. sales volumes decreased primarily due to lower global demand. average selling prices increased in all regions of the world primarily in response to higher raw material costs,
partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar against major international currencies. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins and lower sales volumes. during 2012 and
2011, our pigments segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $4 million and $10 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring
activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 

corporate and other  

corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, last-in
first-out ("lifo") inventory valuation reserve adjustments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unallocated restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, nonoperating income and
expense, benzene sales and gains and losses on the disposition of corporate assets. for 2012, ebitda from corporate and other decreased by $15 million to a loss of $251 million from a
loss of $236 million for 2011. the decrease in ebitda from corporate and other was primarily the

table of contents

result
of an increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt of $73 million ($80 million of loss in 2012 compared to $7 million of loss in 2011). for more information regarding
the loss on early extinguishment of debt, see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated
financial statements. the decrease was also due to higher incentive compensation costs of $19 million and a decrease in unallocated foreign exchange gains of $9 million
($2 million gain in 2012 compared to $11 million gain in 2011). the decrease in ebitda was partially offset by a decrease in legal settlements of $39 million ($1 million in
2012 compared to $40 million in 2011), an increase in lifo inventory valuation income of $35 million ($14 million of income in 2012 compared to $21 million of expense in
2011) and an increase of $15 million in income from benzene sales ($10 million of income in 2012 compared to $5 million of loss in 2011). 

discontinued operations  

the operating results of our former polymers, base chemicals and australian styrenics businesses are classified as discontinued
operations, and, accordingly, the revenues of these businesses are excluded from revenues for all periods presented. the ebitda of these former businesses are included in discontinued operations for
all periods presented. the loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results, legal costs, restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and gain (loss) on disposal with respect
to our former businesses. the decrease in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, resulted primarily from higher legal costs in 2011. see "note 25. discontinued operations" to our
consolidated financial statements. 

year ended december 31, 2011 compared with year ended december 31, 2010  

for year ended december 31, 2011, the net income attributable to huntsman corporation was $247 million on revenues of
$11,221 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman corporation of $27 million on revenues of $9,250 million for 2010. for the year ended december 31, 2011,
the net income attributable to huntsman international was $253 million on revenues of $11,221 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman international of
$180 million on revenues of $9,250 million for 2010. the increase of $220 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the increase of $73 million in net
income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



•revenues for 2011 increased by $1,971 million, or 21%, as compared with 2010. the increase was due principally to
higher average selling prices in all of our segments and higher sales volumes in all of our segments except advanced materials, textile effects and pigments. see "—segment analysis" below.  
•our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for 2011 increased by $379 million and
$380 million, respectively, or 26% each, as compared with 2010. the increase resulted from higher gross margins in all of our segments except advanced materials and textile effects. see
"—segment analysis" below. 
•our operating expenses and the operating expenses of huntsman international for 2011 increased by $45 million and
$56 million, or 4% and 6%, respectively, as compared with 2010. operating expenses increased by $50 million in 2011 due to the impact of translating foreign currency amounts to the u.s.
dollar and by $46 million due to higher expenses related to legal settlements, partially offset by a $12 million gain recorded upon consolidation of our sasol-huntsman joint venture and
a $34 million gain recorded on the sale of our stereolithography resin and digitalis® machine manufacturing businesses. for more information on legal settlements, see
"note 19. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our consolidated financial statements. for more information on the consolidation of our

digitalis® machine manufacturing businesses, see "note 3. business combinations and dispositions" to our consolidated financial statements. 



•restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for 2011 increased to $167 million from $29 million in
2010. for more information, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 
•our net interest expense and the net interest expense of huntsman international for 2011 increased by $20 million
and $14 million, respectively, or 9% and 6%, respectively, as compared with 2010. in 2010, we benefited from a $12 million reduction in interest expense related to the ineffective
portion of a cross currency swap, and interest expense in 2011 is also higher due to the consolidation of our sasol-huntsman and arabian amines company joint ventures. for more information, see
"note 7. variable interest entities" to our consolidated financial statements. 
•equity in income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates for 2011 decreased to $8 million from
$24 million in 2010. during 2010, we recorded a nonrecurring $18 million credit to equity income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates to appropriately reflect our investment in
sasol-huntsman. for more information, see "note 6. investment in unconsolidated affiliates" to our consolidated financial statements. 
•our loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2011 decreased to $7 million from $183 million in 2010 as a
result of higher net repayments of indebtedness in 2010 as compared to 2011. in 2010, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt from the repurchase of our 7% convertible notes due 2018
(huntsman corporation only) for $146 million. for more information see "note 14. debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 
•expenses associated with the terminated merger and related litigation for 2010 consisted primarily of $3 million of
bonuses paid to certain members of the board of directors, upon the recommendation of an independent committee of the board of directors, for their efforts in connection with the litigation with
hexion and apollo following the terminated merger. 
•our income tax expense increased by $80 million to an expense of $109 million for 2011 as compared with an
expense of $29 million for 2010. huntsman international's income tax expense increased by $73 million to an expense of $113 million for 2011, as compared with an expense of
$40 million for 2010. our and huntsman international's tax obligations are affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. other than pre-tax
earnings, our and huntsman international's income tax expense for 2011 as compared with 2010 was primarily impacted by the following: 2011 tax benefits associated with the net release of valuation
allowances of $22 million as compared to 2010 releases of valuation allowances of $20 million; 2011 tax benefits of $1 million compared to the 2010 tax benefits of
$4 million related to recognizing a tax benefit for operating losses in certain jurisdictions with valuation allowances and current other comprehensive income. for more information, see
"note 18. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements. 
•loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2011 was $1 million compared to income from discontinued
operations of $42 million in 2010. the decrease in income from discontinued operations resulted principally from a $110 million pretax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2010 in
connection with the final settlement of our insurance claims related to the 2006 fire at our former port arthur, texas plant, offset in part by related income taxes, legal and other costs. for more
information, see "note 25. discontinued operations" to our consolidated financial statements.

meaningful 
 

polyurethanes  

the increase in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher average selling prices and
higher sales volumes. mdi average selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material costs, improved demand and the strength of major european currencies against the u.s. dollar.
po/mtbe average selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material costs and industry supply constraints in the first half of 2011. mdi sales volumes increased primarily in response
to improved demand in the insulation, automotive and composite wood panels sectors. po/mtbe sales volumes increased compared to 2010 primarily due to a planned maintenance outage at our port neches,
texas facility during 2010. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins, partially offset by higher manufacturing and selling, general and administrative
costs. segment ebitda in 2010 was also negatively impacted by an estimated $40 million as a result of the planned maintenance outage at our port neches, texas facility. 

performance products  

the increase in revenues in our performance products segment for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher average selling
prices and higher sales volumes. average selling prices increased across all product groups principally in response to higher raw material costs and the strength of major european currencies against
the u.s. dollar. sales volumes increased mainly due to higher demand for ethyleneamines and eg, offset by lower sales of other amines and european surfactants. in addition, sales volumes increased as
a result of our consolidation of the sasol-huntsman joint venture and our acquisition of the chemical business of laffans petrochemicals limited (the "laffans acquisition"), both in april 2011. the
increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher margins as selling prices increased faster than raw material prices, partially offset by increased fixed costs. in
addition, in 2011, we recorded a gain of $12 million in connection with the consolidation of the sasol-huntsman joint venture, and in 2010, we recorded a nonrecurring $18 million credit
to appropriately reflect our investment in the sasol-huntsman joint venture.

prices
increased in all regions and across the entire product portfolio in response to higher raw material costs and the strength of major european currencies against the u.s. dollar. sales volumes
decreased in the asia-pacific region, primarily as a result of lower demand in the wind energy market, as well as in europe and the americas, while sales volumes increased in india. the
decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins, the impact of stronger major european currencies against the u.s. dollar, higher manufacturing and selling, general and administrative
costs and higher restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs. during 2011 and 2010, our advanced materials segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing charges (credits) of
$20 million and $(2) million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated
financial statements. 

textile effects  

the decrease in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2011 compared to 2010 was due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by
higher average selling prices. sales volumes decreased due to weak retail demand and customer manufacturing constraints. average selling prices increased primarily from the strength of major
international currencies against the u.s. dollar. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, lower sales volumes and the negative
foreign currency impact of a stronger swiss franc against the u.s. dollar on our manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs. during 2011 and 2010, our textile effects segment recorded
restructuring, impairment and plant closing charges of $135 and $15 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring,
impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 

pigments  

the increase in revenues in our pigments segment for 2011 compared to 2010 was due to higher average selling prices partially offset by
lower sales volumes. average selling prices increased in all regions of the world driven principally by higher raw materials costs and stronger overall market demand during the first half of 2011.
sales volumes decreased primarily due to decreased global demand in the last quarter of 2011, particularly in the asia-pacific, africa, middle east and latin america regions. the increase
in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher margins, partially offset by higher manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs. 

corporate and other—huntsman corporation  

corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, lifo inventory valuation
reserve adjustments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unallocated restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and nonoperating income and expense. for 2011, ebitda from corporate and other
increased by $148 million to a loss of $236 million from a loss of $384 million for 2010. the increase in ebitda from corporate and other for 2011 resulted primarily from a
decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt of $176 million ($7 million of losses in 2011 compared to $183 million of losses in 2010), an increase in treasury gains of
$7 million ($11 million in gains in 2011 compared to $4 million in gains in 2010), a decrease in restructuring costs of $3 million ($2 million in losses in 2011
compared to $5 million in losses in 2010), a decrease in merger-related expenses of $4 million and an increase in the extraordinary gain on the textile effects acquisition of
$5 million ($4 million gain in 2011 compared to $1 million loss in 2010), and was partially offset by a $32 million increase in legal settlements ($40 million loss
in 2011 compared to $8 million loss in 2010), a $4 million increase in lifo inventory valuation expense ($22 million of expense in 2011 compared to $18 million of expense
in 2010) and a $5 million loss during 2011 in benzene purchases, raw material purchased to supply our polyurethanes and performance products businesses. for more information regarding the loss

corporate and other for 2011 resulted primarily from a $32 million increase in legal settlements ($40 million loss in 2011 compared to $8 million loss in 2010), a
$4 million increase in lifo inventory valuation expense ($22 million of expense in 2011 compared to $18 million of expense in 2010), a $5 million loss during 2011 in
benzene purchases, raw material purchased to supply our polyurethanes and performance products businesses, and a $10 million decrease in operating income due to the sale of corporate assets to

of losses in 2010), an increase in treasury gains of $7 million ($11 million in gains in 2011 compared to $4 million in gains in 2010), a decrease in restructuring costs of
$3 million ($2 million in losses in 2011 compared to $5 million in losses in 2010) and an increase in the extraordinary gain on the textile effects acquisition of

table of contents 

cash flows for year ended december 31, 2012 compared to the year ended december 31, 2011  

net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 and 2011 was $774 million and $365 million, respectively. the increase
in net cash provided by operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described in "—results of operations" above and
to a $179 million favorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2012 as compared with 2011. 


net
cash used in investing activities for 2012 and 2011 was $471 million and $280 million, respectively. during 2012 and 2011, we paid $412 million and
$327 million, respectively, for capital expenditures, net of reimbursements. during 2012, we paid €13 million (approximately $16 million) for the russian systems
house acquisition. during 2011, we paid $34 million, net of cash acquired, for the laffans acquisition and the acquisition of an mdi-based polyurethanes systems house in istanbul,
turkey. on april 1, 2011, we began consolidating our sasol-huntsman joint venture and assumed its cash balance of $28 million. during 2011, we sold businesses and assets for
$48 million, including the sale of our former stereolithography resin and digitalis® machine manufacturing businesses for $41 million. during 2012 and 2011, we made
investments in louisiana pigments company, l.p. of $100 million and $26 million, respectively, and received dividends from our
unconsolidated joint ventures, louisiana pigments company, l.p. and basf huntsman shanghai isocyanate investment b.v., of $82 million and $32 million, respectively.
additionally during 2012, we made investments in our nanjing jinling joint venture and our cost method investment in white mountain titanium corporation of $24 million and $3 million,
respectively. 

net
cash used in financing activities for 2012 and 2011 was $473 million and $490 million, respectively. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily
due to the repurchase of $50 million of common stock in 2011, offset in part by higher net repayments of debt in 2012 as compared to 2011. 

during
2012, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2020 ("2020 senior notes") and used the net proceeds to redeem a portion of our 2016
senior notes. additionally, during 2012 we repaid $139 million on our senior secured credit facilities. for more information, see "note 14. debt" to our consolidated financial
statements. 


cash flows for year ended december 31, 2011 compared to the year ended december 31, 2010  

net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for 2011 and 2010 was $365 million and $(58) million, respectively. the
increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described in "—results of operations" above
and a $420 million favorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2011 as compared with 2010. upon the adoption of new accounting guidance on january 1, 2010, sales of
accounts receivable under our accounts receivable programs (our "a/r programs") no longer meet the criteria for derecognition and off-balance sheet treatment. accordingly, the amounts
outstanding under our a/r programs are accounted for as secured borrowings and were included on our balance sheet. as a result of the adoption of this new guidance, accounts receivable increased by
$254 million and a corresponding increase in cash used in operating activities was reflected in the statement of cash flows for 2010. 

net
cash used in investing activities for 2011 and 2010 was $280 million and $182 million, respectively. during 2011 and 2010, we paid $327 million and
$202 million, respectively, for capital expenditures, net of reimbursements. during 2011, we paid $34 million, net of cash acquired, for the laffans acquisition and the acquisition of an
mdi-based polyurethanes systems house in istanbul, turkey. on april 1, 2011, we began consolidating the sasol-huntsman joint venture and assumed its cash balance of
$28 million. during 2011, we sold businesses and assets for $48 million, including the sale of our former stereolithography resin and digitalis® machine manufacturing
businesses for

$41 million.
during 2011, we received $32 million of dividends from our unconsolidated joint ventures, louisiana pigment company, l.p. and basf huntsman shanghai isocyanate
investment b.v., and made investments in louisiana pigment company, l.p. of $26 million. during 2010, we received proceeds of $110 million from the settlement of our
insurance claims related to the 2006 fire at our former port arthur, texas facility, $34 million of which was reflected in the statement of cash flows as investing activities. 

net
cash used in financing activities for 2011 and 2010 was $490 million and $543 million, respectively. this decrease in net cash used in financing activities was
primarily due to higher net repayments of debt in 2010 as compared to 2011 and a $154 million reduction in call premiums paid related to early extinguishment of debt in 2010, offset in part by
the repurchase of $50 million of common stock in 2011 and by the on-balance sheet treatment of our a/r programs in 2010. for more information regarding the call premiums paid, see
"note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements. for more information
regarding the repurchase of common stock, see "note 21. huntsman corporation stockholders' equity—share repurchase program" to our consolidated financial statements.

(1)represents
opening balance sheet amounts related to the russian systems house acquisition. 


excluding
the effects of the russian systems house acquisition, our working capital decreased by $187 million as a result of the net impact of the following significant
changes:


•the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $167 million resulted from the matters identified in the consolidated
statements of cash flows. 
•accounts receivable, net increased by $47 million mainly due to higher sales prices and volumes, offset in part by
the impact of foreign currency translation. 
•inventories increased by $271 million mainly due to higher inventory levels to support increased customer demand
and in anticipation of maintenance outages planned for the first half of 2013.

table of contents
 
 

•the increase in accounts payable of $234 million was primarily due to higher inventory.  
•current portion of debt increased by $76 million due primarily to the classification of $180 million of
arabian amines company debt as current, offset in part by the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, a portion of which was classified as current as of december 31, 2011. see "note 14.
debt—direct and subsidiary debt—other debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 

 
direct and subsidiary debt  

huntsman corporation's direct debt and guarantee obligations consist of a guarantee of certain indebtedness incurred from time to time
to finance certain insurance premiums. substantially all of our other debt, including the facilities described below, has been incurred by our subsidiaries (primarily huntsman international); huntsman
corporation is not a guarantor of such subsidiary debt. 

certain
of our subsidiaries are designated as nonguarantor subsidiaries and have third-party debt agreements. these debt agreements contain certain restrictions with regard to dividends,
distributions, loans or advances. in certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to us. 


senior credit facilities  

as of december 31, 2012, our senior secured credit facilities ("senior credit facilities") consisted of our revolving facility
("revolving facility"), our term loan b facility ("term loan b"), our extended term loan b facility ("extended term loan b"), our extended term loan b facility—series 2 ("extended
term loan b—series 2"), and our term loan c facility ("term loan c") as follows (dollars in millions):

(1)we
had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility; we had approximately $19 million (u.s. dollar equivalents) of letters of credit and
bank guarantees issued and outstanding under our revolving facility.
(2)the
applicable interest rate of the senior credit facilities is subject to certain secured leverage ratio thresholds. as of december 31, 2012, the

to repay our 2016 senior notes, term loan b due april 19, 2014 and term loan c due june 30, 2016. the maturity of extended term loan b and extended term loan
b—series 2 will accelerate if we do not repay, refinance or have a minimum level of liquidity available to enable us to refinance or repay our 2016 senior notes that remain
outstanding during the three months prior to the maturity date of such notes. 
 
our
obligations under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by our guarantors, which consist of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and certain of our foreign
subsidiaries, and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic property, plant and equipment, the stock of

all
of our material domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries, and pledges of intercompany notes between certain of our subsidiaries. 

during
the year ended december 31, 2012, we made the following payments on our senior credit facilities:



•on october 31, 2012, we prepaid $50 million on our term loan b.  
•on september 24, 2012, we prepaid $58 million on our term loan b.

•on april 2, 2012, we paid the annual scheduled repayment of $3 million on our term loan b, $7 million
on our extended term loan b and $4 million on our term loan c. 


in
connection with these debt repayments, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2 million during the year ended december 31, 2012.

2020 senior notes bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per year payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15 of each year, beginning on may 15,
2013 and are due on november 15, 2020. huntsman international may redeem the 2020 senior notes in whole or in part at any time prior to august 17, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the

principal properties, incur indebtedness of nonguarantor subsidiaries, enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to any principal properties and consolidate or merge with or into any
other person or lease, sell or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets. upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, holders of the 2020 senior notes will have the

variable interest entity debt  

as of december 31, 2012, arabian amines company had $180 million outstanding under its loan commitments and debt
financing arrangements described below. arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, is currently not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained under these loan
commitments. we do not guaranty these loan commitments and arabian amines company is not a guarantor of any of our other debt obligations, and the noncompliance with these financial covenants does not
affect any of our other debt obligations. arabian amines company is currently in discussions with the lenders under these loan commitments and expects to resolve the noncompliance. the amounts
outstanding under these loan commitments were classified as current on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2012. 



•a loan facility from saudi industrial development fund with sar 472 million (approximately $126 million)
outstanding. repayment of the loan is to be made in semiannual installments that began in 2012, with final maturity in 2019. the loan is secured by a mortgage over the fixed assets of the project and

table of contents

under
the term loan facility. the facility will be repaid over semiannual installments that began in 2011, with the final repayment scheduled for december 2018. obligations under the facility
agreement are secured by, among other things, first priority right on the property, plant and equipment of sasol-huntsman 

other debt  

during the year ended december 31, 2012, hps repaid $4 million and rmb 120 million (approximately
$19 million) on term loans and working capital loans under its secured facilities. as of december 31, 2012, hps had $8 million and rmb 354 million (approximately
$56 million) outstanding under its secured facilities. the interest rate on these facilities is libor plus 0.48% for u.s. dollar borrowings and approximately 90% of the peoples bank of china
rate for rmb borrowings. as of december 31, 2012, the interest rate was approximately 1% for the u.s. dollar borrowings and approximately 6% for rmb borrowings. during 2012, the lenders
released our company as a guarantor. 

during
the year ended december 31, 2012, hps repaid rmb 309 million (approximately $50 million) under its loan facility for working capital loans and discounting of
commercial drafts. as of december 31, 2012, hps had rmb 190 million (approximately $30 million) outstanding, which is classified as current portion of debt on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets . interest is calculated using a peoples bank of china rate plus the applicable margin. the average all-in rate as of december 31, 2012 was approximately
6%. 

on
march 30, 2012, we repaid the remaining a$26 million (approximately $27 million) outstanding under our australian credit facility, which represents repayment of
a$14 million (approximately $15 million) under the revolving facility and a$12 million (approximately $12 million) under the term loan facility. 


note payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation  

as of december 31, 2012, we had a loan of $695 million to our subsidiary, huntsman international (the "intercompany
note"). the intercompany note is unsecured and $100 million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december 31, 2012 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. as
of december 31, 2012, under the terms of the intercompany note, huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous
monthly average borrowing rate obtained under our u.s. a/r program, less 10 basis points (provided that the rate shall not exceed an amount that is 25 basis points less than the monthly average
borrowing rate obtained for the u.s. libor-based borrowings under our revolving facility). 

compliance with covenants  

we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including
our senior credit facilities, our a/r programs and our notes. however, arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, is currently not in compliance with certain financial covenants
under its loan commitments. see "—variable interest entity debt" above. 


our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable. furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a
failure to 

83




 

table of contents

comply
with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement. 

our
senior credit facilities are subject to a single financial covenant (the "leverage covenant") which applies only to the revolving facility and is tested at the huntsman international
level. the leverage covenant is applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not
deemed outstanding). the leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international's ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda (as defined in the
applicable agreement) is not more than 3.75 to 1. 

if
in the future huntsman international fails to comply with the leverage covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility. if huntsman international
failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility, huntsman international would be in default under
the senior credit facilities, and, unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), huntsman international could
be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities. 

the
agreements governing our a/r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. any material failure to meet the applicable a/r programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the a/r programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the a/r programs in full. an early termination event under the a/r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit
facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities. 

short-term and long-term liquidity  

we depend upon our cash, credit facilities, a/r programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working
capital needs. as of december 31, 2012, we had $887 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity, consisting of $396 million in cash and restricted cash,
$381 million in availability under our revolving facility, and $110 million in availability under our a/r programs. our liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors. the
following matters had, or are expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity:



•cash invested in our accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable, increased by approximately
$102 million during 2012, as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. we expect volatility in our working capital components to continue.  
•during 2013, we expect to spend approximately $450 million on capital expenditures. we expect to fund this spending
with cash provided by operations. 
•during 2012, we made contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans of $159 million. during 2013, we
expect to contribute an additional amount of approximately $166 million to these plans. 
•during the year ended december 31, 2012, huntsman international redeemed €64 million
(approximately $86 million) of its 7.50% senior subordinated notes due 2015, repaid $139 million on our senior secured credit facility, repaid a$26 million (approximately
$27 million) related to our australian credit facility ("australian credit facility"), and repaid $4 million and rmb 429 million (approximately $69 million) associated with
our various hps debt facilities. in

addition,
on november 19, 2012 we completed our $400 million offering of 2020 senior notes and used proceeds to redeem $400 million of our 2016 senior notes. 



•we are also involved in a number of cost reduction programs for which we have established restructuring accruals. as of
december 31, 2012, we had $105 million of accrued restructuring costs from continuing operations and we expect to incur and pay additional restructuring and plant closing costs of up to
approximately $102 million. 




on
september 8, 2009, we announced the closure of our styrenics facility located at west footscray, australia. we ceased the australian styrenics operations during the first quarter of 2010. as
of december 31, 2012, we had restructuring accruals of $6 million and environmental remediation accruals of $29 million. we can provide no assurance that the eventual
environmental remediation costs will not be materially different from our current estimate. the plant closure and environmental remediation costs are expected to be funded as they are incurred over
the next several years. 



•on august 5, 2011, we announced that our board of directors has authorized our company to repurchase up to
$100 million in shares of our common stock. during 2011, we acquired approximately four million shares of our outstanding common stock for approximately $50 million under the repurchase
program. as of december 31, 2012, there remained approximately $50 million of the amount authorized under the program that could be used for stock repurchases. these repurchases may be
commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. 
•we regularly evaluate conditions in the term loan and bond markets with a view to obtaining additional financing to repay
currently outstanding borrowings and for general corporate purposes. 


as
of december 31, 2012, we had $288 million classified as current portion of debt which consists of certain scheduled term payments and various short-term
facilities including an hps borrowing facility in china with $39 million outstanding, debt at our variable interest entities of $193 million, $15 million related to the annual
financing of our insurance premiums, and certain other short-term facilities and scheduled amortization payments totaling $41 million. although we cannot provide assurances, we
intend to renew or extend the majority of these short-term facilities in the current period. for more information, see "note 14. debt" to our consolidated financial statements 

as
of december 31, 2012, we had approximately $191 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries, including our variable
interest entities. additionally, we have material intercompany debt obligations owed to us by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we intend to use cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to fund our
local operations. nevertheless, we could repatriate cash as dividends or as repayments of intercompany debt. if foreign cash were repatriated as dividends, the dividends could be subject to adverse
tax consequences. at present, we
estimate that we will generate sufficient cash in our u.s. operations, together with the payments of intercompany debt if necessary, to meet our cash needs in the u.s and we do not expect to
repatriate material cash amounts to the u.s. as dividends in the near term. cash held by certain foreign subsidiaries, including our variable interest entities, may also be subject to legal
restrictions, including those arising from the interests of our partners, which could limit the amounts available for repatriation.

in the purchase commitments table above are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2010. certain contracts
allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period, such notice period
has been included in the above table. the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations. we have estimated
our contractual obligations by using the terms of our 2009 pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased. we

critical accounting policies

the
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. our significant accounting policies are summarized in "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies"
to our consolidated financial statements. summarized below are our critical accounting policies: 

contingent loss accruals  

environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation, available technology, site-specific information and remediation alternatives. we
accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information. the extent of environmental impacts may not be fully known and the processes and costs of
remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available,
technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage. adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation
progresses. for further information, see "note 20. environmental, health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 

we
are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of
probable losses. a determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. we have an active risk management program
consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. these policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. the
required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. for further information, see "note 19. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our
consolidated financial statements. 

employee benefit programs  

we sponsor several contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans, covering employees primarily in the u.s., the
u.k., the netherlands, belgium
and switzerland, but also covering employees in a number of other countries. we fund the material plans through trust arrangements (or local equivalents) where the assets are held separately from us.
we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the u.s., canada and south africa. amounts recorded in the
consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries. inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected
long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, compensation increases, mortality rates and health care cost trends. these

assumptions
are described in "note 17. employee benefit plans" to our consolidated financial statements. 

management,
with the advice of actuaries, uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based. the effect
of a 1% change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

fair value  

pursuant to the settlement agreement reached in our litigation with the banks that had entered into a commitment letter to provide
funding for the hexion merger (the "texas bank litigation settlement agreement"), on june 22, 2009, huntsman international entered into an amendment of its senior credit facilities that
provided for term loan c with a $500 million principal amount, and huntsman international also issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2016 senior notes. in accordance with
accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements, we recorded the term loan c and the 2016 senior notes in our accounting records at fair values of $439 million and $425 million,
respectively, upon initial recognition in june 2009. in november 2012, huntsman international completed a $400 million offering of its 2020 senior notes and used the net proceeds to redeem
$400 million of the aggregate principal amount of its 2016 senior notes. 

we
primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of these instruments. fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows calculated using interest
rates that were available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms, adjusted for differences in remaining maturity using relevant debt yield curves. 


management
used judgment with respect to assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the term loan c and the 2016 senior notes. the effect of the following changes in certain key
assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

goodwill  

we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. currently, more
than 70% of our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit. the remaining goodwill relates to four other reporting units. 

fair
value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. the estimated fair values of our reporting units are
dependent on several significant assumptions including, among others, market information, operating results, earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows. 

we
tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2012 as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
our most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of our advanced materials reporting unit by a significant margin. 

income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they
will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the
realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we
consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence
such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. as of
december 31, 2012, we had total valuation allowances of $736 million. please see "note 18. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding
our valuation allowances. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as
earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. the undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately $215 million at december 31, 2012. it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized
deferred tax liability on those earnings. we have material inter-company debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to repatriate earnings to the u.s.
via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation, combined with the ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of inter-company debt owned by our non-u.s.
subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend we will utilize our inter-company debt. if any earnings were
repatriated via dividend, we would need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. 

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of
more-likely-than-not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make
significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of 

89




 

table of contents

income
tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in
order to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by
the taxing authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts
recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 

long-lived assets  

the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience, engineering estimates and
industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets. the estimated lives of our property range from 3 to
33 years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method. inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of
annual capital expenditures will be performed. without on-going capital improvements and maintenance, the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would
be shorter. 

management
uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. at december 31, 2012, if the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and
equipment had either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives, then depreciation expense for 2012 would have been approximately $30 million less or $35 million
greater, respectively. 

we
are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in
the future or when management's plans change regarding those assets, such as idling or closing a plant. we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values. key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life, technology, competitive pressures,
raw material pricing and regulations. in connection with our asset evaluation policy, we reviewed all of our long-lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. we determined that such indicators did not exist during the year ended december 31, 2012. 


restructuring and plant closing costs  

we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations, workforce reductions and
other cost savings programs in each of our segments, other than performance products. these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan.
estimates for plant closing costs include the write-off of the carrying value of the plant, any necessary environmental and/or regulatory costs, contract termination and demolition costs.
estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated, termination benefits to be provided and other information, as
necessary. management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the currently recorded estimate. for
further discussion of our restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 

revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the 

90




 

table of contents

customer,
collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 

revenue
arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, which relate primarily to the licensing of technology, are evaluated in accordance with asc 605-25,  revenue recognition—multiple-element arrangements, to determine whether the arrangements
should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting. 

variable interest entities—primary beneficiary  

we evaluate each of our variable interest entities on an on-going basis to determine whether we are the primary
beneficiary. management assesses, on an on-going basis, the nature of our relationship to the variable interest entity, including the amount of control that we exercise over the entity as
well as the amount of risk that we bear and rewards we receive in regards to the entity, to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. management judgment is
required to assess whether these attributes are significant. we consolidate all variable interest entities for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary.  

 
item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk        

we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks. from time to
time, we enter into transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations.
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

interest rate risks

through
our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio, including the duration of
the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as
well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate
long-term debt. under interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties (major banks) the amounts, if any, by which our interest
payments on certain of our floating-rate borrowings exceed a certain rate, and require us to pay to the counterparties (major banks) the amount, if any, by which our interest payments on
certain of our floating-rate borrowings are less than a certain rate. 

on
december 9, 2009, we entered into a five-year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in
libor under our senior credit facilities. the notional value of the contract is $50 million, and it has been designated as a cash flow hedge. the effective portion of the changes in the fair
value of the swap was recorded in other comprehensive loss. we will pay a fixed 2.6% on the hedge and receive the one-month libor rate. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 the fair
value of the hedge was $2 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. 


on
january 19, 2010, we entered into an additional five-year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated
changes in libor under our 

91




 

table of contents

senior
credit facilities. the notional value of the contract is $50 million, and it has been designated as a cash flow hedge. the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swap
was recorded as other comprehensive loss. we will pay a fixed 2.8% on the hedge and receive the one-month libor rate. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of the hedge
was $3 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. 

on
september 1, 2011, we entered into a $50 million forward interest rate contract that will begin in december 2014 with maturity in april 2017 and a $50 million
forward interest rate contract that will begin in january 2015 with maturity in april 2017. these two forward contracts are to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to
associated changes in libor under our senior credit facilities once our existing interest rate hedges mature. these swaps are designated as a cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes
in the fair value of the swaps were recorded in other comprehensive income. both interest rate contracts will pay a fixed 2.5% on the hedge and receive the one-month libor rate once the
contracts begin in 2014 and 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the combined fair value of these two hedges was $4 million and $1 million, respectively and was
recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. 

in
2009, sasol-huntsman entered into derivative transactions to hedge the variable interest rate associated with its local credit facility. these derivative rate hedges include a
floating to fixed interest rate contract providing sasol-huntsman with euribor interest payments for a fixed payment of 3.62% and a cap for future periods with a strike price of 3.62%. in connection
with the consolidation of sasol-huntsman as of april 1, 2011, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable interest entities" to our
consolidated financial statements. the notional amount of the hedge as of december 31, 2012 was €47 million (approximately $62 million) and the derivative
transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of this hedge was €2 million (approximately $3 million) and
€3 million (approximately $3 million), respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. for 2012 and 2011,
we recorded additional (reduction of) interest expense of less than €(1) million (approximately $(1) million) and €2 million (approximately $2 million)
respectively, due to changes in the fair value of the swap. 

beginning
in 2009, arabian amines company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed
payment of 5.02%. in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7.
variable interest entities" to our consolidated financial statements. the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2012 was $36 million, and the interest rate contract is not
designated as a cash flow hedge. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of the swap was $6 million and $6 million, respectively, and was recorded as other noncurrent
liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. for 2012 and 2011, we recorded additional (reduction of) interest expense of less than $(1) million and $1 million,
respectively, due to changes in fair value of the swap. as of december 31, 2012 arabian amines company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in its loan commitments.
for more information, see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—variable interest entity debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 

for
the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with these cash flow hedging activities was approximately
$1 million and $4 million, respectively. 

during
2013, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates.

foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in
various currencies. we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net
multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market
transactions, principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner
that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, we had approximately $217 million and $263 million
notional amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding, respectively, in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 


in
conjunction with the issuance of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due 2020, we entered into cross-currency interest rate contracts with three counterparties. on march 17,
2010, we made payments of $350 million to these counterparties and received €255 million from these counterparties, and on maturity (march 15, 2015) we are
required to pay €255 million to these counterparties and will receive $350 million from these counterparties. on march 15 and
september 15 of each year, we will receive u.s. dollar interest payments of approximately $15 million (equivalent to an annual rate of 8.625%) and make interest payments of approximately
€11 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 8.41%). this swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. as of
december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of this swap was $18 million and $27 million, respectively, and was recorded in noncurrent assets. 

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies
other than the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain
intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future ("permanent loans") and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2012, we have
designated approximately €255 million (approximately $336 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net
investment. for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the amount of gain (loss) recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $(11) million, $5 million and
$34 million, respectively, and was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. as of december 31, 2012, we had approximately €1,083 million (approximately
$1,431 million) in net euro assets. 

commodity prices risk  

our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market
related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we
do not generally hedge our commodity exposures.

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act) as of december 31, 2012. based on this evaluation, our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of december 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's
rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

changes in internal control over financial reporting  

no changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2012 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
exchange act). 

management's report on internal control over financial reporting  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control
framework and processes for our company and huntsman international are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management, huntsman international's board of managers and our board of directors
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of
america. 

our
internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international includes those policies and procedures that:



•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of our company and huntsman international; 
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded properly to allow for the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company and huntsman international are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of our company and huntsman international;

•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and
•provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud. 


because
of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. further,
because of changing conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 

our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international and concluded that, as of december 31, 2012,
such internal control is effective. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in  internal control—integrated
framework ("coso"). 


our
independent registered public accountants, deloitte & touche llp, with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee, have audited the
consolidated financial statements prepared by our company and huntsman international and have issued attestation reports on internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman
international.

management's process to assess the effectiveness of  internal control over financial reporting        

to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we completed a comprehensive compliance
process to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international. we involved employees at all levels of our company during 2012 in training, performing and
evaluating our internal controls. 

our
management's conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the five elements of coso. our
management considered information from multiple sources as the basis its conclusion—including self-assessments of the control activities within each work process, assessments
of division-level and entity-level controls and internal control attestations from key external service providers, as well as from key management. in addition, our internal control processes contain
self-monitoring mechanisms, and proactive steps are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. we also maintain an internal auditing program that independently assesses the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting within each of the five coso elements.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2012, based on criteria established in  internal control—integrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying management's report on internal control over
financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 


we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in  internal control—integrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2012. our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. 


we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31,
2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

as
discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company adopted new accounting guidance which changed its method of accounting for transfers of accounts
receivable under the company's accounts receivable securitization programs, effective january 1, 2010. 


we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 12, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of managers and members of
huntsman international llc and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2012. our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 

we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries as of
december 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended december 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

as
discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company adopted new accounting guidance which changed its method of accounting for transfers of accounts
receivable under the company's accounts receivable securitization programs, effective january 1, 2010. 

we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 12, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

definitions  

for convenience in this report, the terms "company," "our" or "we" may be used to refer to huntsman corporation and, unless the context
otherwise requires, its subsidiaries and predecessors. any references to our "company" "we" "us" or "our" as of a date prior to october 19, 2004 (the date of our company's formation) are to
huntsman holdings, llc and its subsidiaries (including their respective predecessors). in this report, "huntsman international" refers to huntsman international llc (our 100% owned
subsidiary) and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries; "hps" refers to huntsman polyurethanes shanghai ltd. (our consolidated splitting joint venture with shanghai
chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd); and "slic" refers to shanghai liengheng isocyanate company (our unconsolidated manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies). 

in
this report, we may use, without definition, the common names of competitors or other industry participants. we may also use the common names or abbreviations for certain chemicals or
products. 

description of business  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our products comprise a
broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers.
our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable
consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of
our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes and titanium dioxide. 

we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and
textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products. in a series of transactions beginning in 2006, we sold or
shutdown substantially all of our australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations. we report the results of these businesses as discontinued operations.
see "note 25. discontinued operations." 

company  

our company, a delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the huntsman businesses. jon m. huntsman founded the predecessor
to our company in 1970 as a small packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 


currently,
we operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in
1999.

1. general (continued) 

huntsman corporation and huntsman international financial statements  

except where otherwise indicated, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both our company and huntsman
international. the differences between our
consolidated financial statements and huntsman international's consolidated financial statements relate primarily to the following:



•purchase accounting recorded at our company for the 2003 step-acquisition of huntsman international
holdings llc, the former parent company of huntsman international that was merged into huntsman international in 2005; 
•the different capital structures; 
•a note payable from huntsman international to us; 
•expenses associated with the terminated merger and related litigation; 


2. summary of significant accounting policies  

allowance for doubtful trade receivables  


an allowance for doubtful trade receivables is estimated based on a combination of write-off history, aging analysis and
any specific, known troubled accounts. 

asset retirement obligations  

we accrue for asset retirement obligations, which consist primarily of landfill closure costs and asbestos abatement costs, in the
period in which the obligations are incurred. asset retirement obligations are accrued at estimated fair value. when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. over time, the liability is accreted to its settlement value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. upon settlement of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded. see "note 12. asset retirement
obligations." 

carrying value of long-lived assets  

we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability is based upon current and anticipated undiscounted cash flows, and we recognize an impairment
when such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between carrying value and fair value. fair
value is generally estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing
costs." 

cash and cash equivalents  

we consider cash in checking accounts and cash in short-term highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase, to be cash and cash equivalents.

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

cash
flows from discontinued operations are not presented separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. 

cost of goods sold  

we classify the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products as cost of goods sold. manufacturing costs include variable costs,
primarily raw materials and energy, and fixed expenses directly associated with production. manufacturing costs also include, among other things, plant site operating costs and overhead (including
depreciation), production planning and logistics costs, repair and maintenance costs, plant site purchasing costs, and engineering and technical support costs. distribution, freight and warehousing
costs are also included in cost of goods sold. 

derivatives and hedging activities  

all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. if the derivative
is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in
the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain international operations are recorded in other comprehensive income, to the extent effective. the effectiveness of a cash flow
hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge, and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three months. a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is
determined to be effective if the change in value of the hedge divided
by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of 80% to 125%. hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument
exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction. for a derivative that does not qualify or has not been designated as a hedge, changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings. 

environmental expenditures  

environmental related restoration and remediation costs are recorded as liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation
and clean-up obligations are either known or considered probable and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. other environmental expenditures that are principally maintenance or
preventative in nature are recorded when expended and incurred and are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. see "note 20. environmental, health and safety matters." 

financial instruments  

the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. the fair value of non-qualified employee benefit plan investments is estimated using
prevailing market prices. the estimated fair values of our long-term debt are based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market.

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

foreign currency translation  

the accounts of our operating subsidiaries outside of the u.s., unless they are operating in highly inflationary economic environments,
consider the functional currency to be the currency of the economic environment in which they operate. accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
revenues, expenses, gains and losses are
translated at a weighted average rate for the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded to equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. 


if
a subsidiary operates in an economic environment that is considered to be highly inflationary (100% cumulative inflation over a three-year period), the u.s. dollar is
considered to be the functional currency and gains and losses from remeasurement to the u.s. dollar from the local currency are included in the statement of operations. where a subsidiary's operations
are effectively run, managed, financed and contracted in u.s. dollars, such as certain finance subsidiaries outside of the u.s., the u.s. dollar is considered to be the functional currency. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other operating (income) expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were net losses of $4 million,
$3 million and $2 million for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they
will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the
realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we
consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence
such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. 


we
do not provide for income taxes or benefits on the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will
continue to be reinvested indefinitely. 

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of
more-likely-than-not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make
significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of
more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in order to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are
based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

would
be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in
assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 

intangible assets and goodwill  


intangible assets are stated at cost (fair value at the time of acquisition) and are amortized using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives or the life of the related agreement as follows: 
 













patents and technology
 
5 - 30 years


trademarks
 
15 - 30 years


licenses and other agreements
 
5 - 15 years


other intangibles
 
5 - 15 years



 
goodwill
represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not subject to any method of amortization, but is tested for
impairment annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related reporting unit, we are required to reduce the amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings. fair value is estimated using
the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. 

inventories  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using lifo, first-in first-out, and
average costs methods for different components of inventory. 

investment in unconsolidated affiliates  


investments in companies in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for using the equity method.
investments in companies in which we do not exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method. 

legal costs  

we expense legal costs, including those legal costs incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. 


net income per share attributable to huntsman corporation  

basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to huntsman corporation common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. diluted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is
computed by dividing net income available to huntsman corporation common

additional
stock-based awards of 7.8 million, 6.7 million and 11.5 million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the years ended
december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. however, these stock-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the respective periods mentioned because
the effect would be anti-dilutive. 

the
impact of the share repurchase program did not increase earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2012. for more information on the share repurchase program, see
"note 21. huntsman corporation stockholders' equity—share repurchase program." 

other noncurrent assets  

other noncurrent assets consist primarily of spare parts, deferred debt issuance costs, the overfunded portion related to defined
benefit plans for employees and capitalized turnaround costs. debt issuance costs are amortized using the interest method over the term of the related debt. 


principles of consolidation  

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and any variable
interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated, except for intercompany sales between continuing and discontinued
operations.

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  


property, plant and equipment  

property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease term as follows: 
 













buildings and equipment
 
10 - 33 years


plant and equipment
 
3 - 25 years


furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements
 
5 - 20 years



 
interest
expense capitalized as part of plant and equipment was $4 million, $2 million and $1 million for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. 

periodic
maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities (a "turnaround") are accounted for on the deferral basis by capitalizing the costs of the
turnaround and amortizing the costs over the estimated period until the next turnaround. normal maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred. renewals, betterments
and major repairs that materially extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized, and the assets replaced, if any, are retired. 

research and development  

research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the customer,
collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 

revenue
arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, which relate primarily to licensing of technology, are evaluated to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into
separate units
of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting. 

securitization of accounts receivable  

under our a/r programs, we grant an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables to the u.s. spe and the eu spe. this
undivided interest serves as security for the issuance of debt. the a/r programs provide for financing through a conduit program (in both u.s. dollars and euros). receivables transferred under the a/r
programs qualified as sales through december 31, 2009. upon adoption of new accounting guidance on january 1, 2010, transfers of accounts receivable under our a/r programs no longer met
the criteria for derecognition. accordingly, the amounts outstanding under our a/r programs are accounted for as secured borrowings beginning in 2010. see "note 14. debt—a/r
programs."

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

stock-based compensation  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. that cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. see "note 22. stock-based compensation
plan." 

subsequent events  

we have evaluated material subsequent events through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. 

use of estimates  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. 

recently issued accounting pronouncements  

accounting pronouncements adopted during 2012  

in may 2011, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu")
no. 2011-04, fair value measurement (topic 820): amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in u.s. gaap
and ifrss, providing a consistent definition of fair value between u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards ("ifrss") as well as developing common
requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with u.s. gaap and ifrss. the amendments in this asu were effective
prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2011. we adopted the amendments of this asu effective january 1, 2012, and the initial adoption of the
amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
june 2011, the fasb issued asu no. 2011-05, comprehensive income (topic 220): presentation of comprehensive
income, requiring entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but
consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity is eliminated. the amendments do
not change the option to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects, with one amount shown for the aggregate income tax expense or
benefit related to the total of other comprehensive income components. the amendments in this asu were effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after december 15, 2011. we adopted this asu effective january 1, 2012 and have presented our consolidated net income and consolidated comprehensive income in two separate, but
consecutive, statements.

in
september 2011, the fasb issued asu no. 2011-08, intangibles—goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for
impairment. the guidance in this asu is intended to reduce complexity and costs of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a
qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. the amendments in this asu include examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's
fair value is less than its carrying value. the amendments in this asu were effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after
december 15, 2011. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective january 1, 2012, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 

accounting pronouncements pending adoption in future periods  

in july 2012, the fasb issued asu no. 2012-02, intangibles—goodwill and other
(topic 350): testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. the guidance in this asu is intended to reduce complexity and costs of the annual impairment
tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. the amendments
in this asu include examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that an asset's fair value is less than its carrying value. the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim
indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15, 2012 with early adoption permitted. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments
in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

3. business combinations and dispositions  


russian mdi, coatings and systems acquisition  

on july 3, 2012, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 55% ownership interest in international polyurethane
investments b.v. this company's wholly owned subsidiary, huntsman nmg zao, is a leading supplier of polyurethane systems to the adhesives, coatings and footwear markets in russia, ukraine and
belarus and is headquartered in obninsk, russia. the acquisition cost was approximately €13 million (approximately $16 million). the acquired business was integrated into
our polyurethanes segment. transaction costs charged to expense related to this acquisition were not significant. the fair value of our existing 45% ownership interest immediately prior to the
acquisition was $13 million, valued by applying the income approach. key assumptions include a discount rate of 17% and a terminal growth rate of 4%. in connection with this transaction, we
recorded a noncash pretax loss of approximately $4 million in other operating (income) expense on the consolidation of this investment. the long-term debt of approximately
$7 million that was assumed as part of this transaction was repaid shortly after the acquisition date. 

we
have accounted for the russian systems house acquisition using the acquisition method. as such, we analyzed the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. the

the
acquisition cost allocation is preliminary pending final determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including final valuation of working capital,
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and the determination of related deferred taxes. for purposes of this preliminary allocation of fair value, we have assigned any excess of the
acquisition cost over historical carrying values to property, plant and equipment and no amounts have been allocated to goodwill. it is possible that changes to this preliminary allocation could
occur.

textile effects acquisition  

on june 30, 2006, we acquired ciba's textile effects business and accounted for the textile effects acquisition using the
purchase method. as such, we analyzed the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and determined the excess of fair value of net assets over cost. because the
fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed exceeded the purchase price, the value of the long-lived assets acquired was reduced to zero. accordingly, no basis was assigned
to property, plant and equipment or any other non-current nonfinancial assets and the remaining excess was recorded as an extraordinary gain. during 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded an
additional extraordinary gain (loss) on the acquisition of $2 million, $4 million and $(1) million, respectively, related to settlement of contingent purchase price consideration,
the reversal of accruals for certain restructuring and employee termination costs recorded in connection with the textile effects acquisition and a reimbursement by ciba of certain costs pursuant to
the acquisition agreements.

(1)contains
activity for international polyurethanes investments b.v. for the period from january 1, 2012 to the date of consolidation on
july 3, 2012. 
 
in
2008, we and our joint venture partner, the zamil group, formed arabian amines company, our ethyleneamines manufacturing joint venture in jubail, saudi arabia. arabian amines
company's funding requirements have been satisfied through a combination of debt and equity, with the equity already provided on a 50/50 basis by us and the zamil group. trial production commenced in
the second quarter of 2010, and from july 2010, arabian amines company generated significant revenues from the sale of product. the plant has an approximate annual capacity of 60 million
pounds. we purchase and sell all of the production from this joint venture. arabian amines company was accounted for under the equity method during its development stage; we began consolidating this
joint venture beginning july 1, 2010. for more information, see "note 7. variable interest entities." 

during
2010, we recorded an immaterial non-recurring $18 million credit to equity income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates to appropriately reflect our
investment in the sasol-huntsman joint venture. this credit represented a cumulative correction of an error that was also individually immaterial in each year since our initial investment in the joint
venture in 1997. in connection with the expansion of the maleic anhydride capacity at our sasol-huntsman joint venture, a variable interest entity reconsideration event occurred in the second quarter
of 2011 when the plant expansion began production. as a result of our assessment, we concluded that the joint venture is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary.
accordingly, we began consolidating this joint venture during the second quarter of 2011. for more information, see "note 7. variable interest entities."

6. investment in unconsolidated affiliates (continued)  



on november 13, 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec. the joint venture will involve the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility
in china. under the joint venture agreement, we will have a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec will hold a 51% interest. our equity investment is anticipated to be approximately
$120 million, and we expect to receive significant license fees from the joint venture. the timing of equity contributions and license fee payments depends on various factors, but the majority
are intended to be made over the course of the construction period of the plant (expected to be completed by the end of 2014). 


7. variable interest entities  


we evaluate our investments and transactions to identify variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. we hold a variable interest in the following four joint
ventures for which we are the primary beneficiary:



•rubicon llc manufactures products for our polyurethanes and performance products segments. the structure of the
joint venture is such that the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its activities without additional financial support. by virtue of the operating
agreement with this joint venture, we purchase a majority of the output, absorb a majority of the operating costs and provide a majority of the additional funding.  
•pacific iron products sdn bhd manufactures products for our pigments segment. in this joint venture we supply all the raw
materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers. through a fixed price raw materials supply contract with
the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. 
•arabian amines company manufactures products for our performance products segment. prior to july 1, 2010, this
joint venture was in the development stage and the total equity investment at risk was sufficient for the joint venture to finance its activities without additional support. therefore, arabian amines
company was accounted for under the equity method. in july 2010, arabian amines company exited the development stage, which triggered the reconsideration of arabian amines company as a variable
interest entity. as required in the operating agreement governing this joint venture, we purchase all of arabian amines company's production and sell it to our customers. substantially all of the
joint venture's activities are conducted on our behalf. accordingly, we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary and began consolidating arabian amines company beginning july 1, 2010.  
•sasol-huntsman is our 50%-owned joint venture with sasol that owns and operates a maleic anhydride facility in moers,
germany. this joint venture manufactures products for our performance products segment. prior to april 1, 2011, we accounted for sasol-huntsman using the equity method. in april 2011, an
expansion at this facility began production, which triggered the reconsideration of this joint venture as a variable interest entity. the joint venture uses our technology and expertise, and we bear a
disproportionate amount of risk of loss due to a related-party loan to sasol-huntsman for which we bear the default risk. as a result, we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary and began
consolidating sasol-huntsman beginning april 1, 2011.

$8 million was related to damages incurred due to the delayed initial acceptance of the plant. this amount was recorded as other operating (income) expense in the consolidated statements of
operations and included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the remaining $3 million of the settlement was received for the reimbursement
of capital expenditures for work left unfinished by the contractors. this amount was included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

goodwill
of $17 million was recognized upon consolidation of sasol-huntsman, of which approximately $12 million is deductible for income tax purposes. the total amount of
goodwill changed approximately $2 million from the date of consolidation to december 31, 2011, due to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate. all other intangible assets are
being amortized over an average useful life of 18 years. the net change to goodwill in response to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate during 2012 was $1 million. 


sasol-huntsman
had revenues and earnings of $116 million and $7 million, respectively, for the period from the date of consolidation to december 31, 2011. if this
consolidation had occurred on january 1, 2010, the approximate pro forma revenues attributable to both our company and huntsman international would have been $11,259 million and
$9,337 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. there would have been no impact to the combined earnings attributable to us or huntsman international excluding a one-time noncash
gain of approximately $12 million recognized upon consolidation included in other operating income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. upon
consolidation we also recognized a one-time noncash income tax expense of approximately $2 million. the fair value of the noncontrolling interest was estimated to be
$61 million at april 1, 2011. the noncontrolling interest was valued at 50% of the fair value of the net assets as of april 1, 2011, as dictated by the ownership interest
percentages, adjusted for certain tax consequences only applicable to one parent.

approximately 6% for rmb borrowings. during 2012, the lenders released our company as a guarantor. 

during
the year ended december 31, 2012, hps repaid rmb 309 million (approximately $50 million) under its loan facility for working capital loans and discounting of
commercial drafts. as of december 31, 2012, hps had rmb 190 million (approximately $30 million) outstanding, which is classified as current portion of debt on the accompanying

compliance with covenants  

we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including
our senior credit facilities, our a/r programs and our notes. however, arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint
venture, is currently not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its loan commitments. see "—variable interest entity debt" above. 

our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable. furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a
failure to comply with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement. 

our
senior credit facilities are subject to the leverage covenant which applies only to the revolving facility and is tested at the huntsman international level. the leverage covenant is
applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding). the
leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international's ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda (as defined in the applicable agreement) is not
more than 3.75 to 1. 

if
in the future huntsman international fails to comply with the leverage covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility. if huntsman international
failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility, huntsman international would be in default under
the senior credit facilities, and, unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), huntsman international could
be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities. 


the
agreements governing our a/r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. any material failure to meet the applicable a/r programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the a/r programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the a/r programs in full. an early termination event under the a/r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit
facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities.

15. derivative instruments and hedging activities  


we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks. from time to time, we enter into transactions, including
transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net
investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

interest rate risks  

through our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio,
including the duration of the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various
interest bearing liabilities, as well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate
long-term debt. under interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties (major banks) the amounts, if any, by which our interest
payments on certain of our floating-rate borrowings exceed a certain rate, and require us to pay to the counterparties (major banks) the amount, if any, by which our interest payments on
certain of our floating-rate borrowings are less than a certain rate. 

on
december 9, 2009, we entered into a five-year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in
libor under our senior credit facilities. the notional value of the contract is $50 million, and it has been designated as a cash flow hedge. the effective portion of the changes in the fair
value of the swap was recorded in other comprehensive loss. we will pay a fixed 2.6% on the hedge and receive the one-month libor rate. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 the fair
value of the hedge was $2 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities.

on
january 19, 2010, we entered into an additional five-year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated
changes in libor under our senior credit facilities. the notional value of the contract is $50 million, and it has been designated as a cash flow hedge. the effective portion of the changes in
the fair value of the swap was recorded as other comprehensive loss. we will pay a fixed 2.8% on the hedge and receive the one-month libor rate. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011,
the fair value of the hedge was $3 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. 

on
september 1, 2011, we entered into a $50 million forward interest rate contract that will begin in december 2014 with maturity in april 2017 and a $50 million
forward interest rate contract that will begin in january 2015 with maturity in april 2017. these two forward contracts are to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to
associated changes in libor under our senior credit facilities once our existing interest rate hedges mature. these swaps are designated as a cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes
in the fair value of the swaps were recorded in other comprehensive income. both interest rate contracts will pay a fixed 2.5% on the hedge and receive the one-month libor rate once the
contracts begin in 2014 and 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the combined fair value of these two hedges was $4 million and $1 million, respectively and was
recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. 

in
2009, sasol-huntsman entered into derivative transactions to hedge the variable interest rate associated with its local credit facility. these derivative rate hedges include a
floating to fixed interest rate contract providing sasol-huntsman with euribor interest payments for a fixed payment of 3.62% and a cap for future periods with a strike price of 3.62%. in connection
with the consolidation of sasol-huntsman as of april 1, 2011, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable interest entities." the
notional amount of the hedge as of december 31, 2012 was €47 million (approximately $62 million) and the derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge
accounting. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of this hedge was €2 million (approximately $3 million) and €3 million
(approximately $3 million), respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. for 2012 and 2011, we recorded additional (reduction
of) interest expense of less than €(1) million (approximately $(1) million) and €2 million (approximately $2 million) respectively, due to changes in the
fair value of the swap. 

beginning
in 2009, arabian amines company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed
payment of 5.02%. in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7.
variable interest entities." the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2012 was $36 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. as of
december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of the swap was $6 million and $6 million, respectively, and was recorded as other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. for 2012 and 2011, we recorded additional (reduction of) interest expense of less than $(1) million and $1 million, respectively, due to changes in fair value of
the swap. as of december 31, 2012 arabian amines company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in its loan commitments. for more information, see "note 14.

15. derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued)  



for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with these cash flow hedging activities was approximately
$1 million and $4 million, respectively. 

during
2013, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 

foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in
various currencies. we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net
multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market
transactions, principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner
that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, we had approximately $217 million and $263 million
notional amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding, respectively, in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 

in
conjunction with the issuance of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due 2020, we entered into cross-currency interest rate contracts with three counterparties. on march 17,
2010, we made payments of $350 million to these counterparties and received €255 million from these counterparties, and on maturity (march 15, 2015) we are
required to pay €255 million to these counterparties and will receive $350 million from these counterparties. on march 15 and september 15 of each year, we
will receive u.s. dollar interest payments of approximately $15 million (equivalent to an annual rate of 8.625%) and make interest payments of approximately €11 million
(equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 8.41%). this swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of
this swap was $18 million and $27 million, respectively, and was recorded in noncurrent assets. 

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies
other than the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain
intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on

15. derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued) 

intercompany
loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2012, we have
designated approximately €255 million (approximately $336 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net
investment. for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the amount of gain (loss) recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $(11) million, $5 million and
$34 million, respectively, and was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. as of december 31, 2012, we had approximately €1,083 million (approximately
$1,431 million) in net euro assets. 

commodity prices risk  

our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market
related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we
do not generally hedge our commodity exposures.

(1)we
are party to cross-currency interest rate contracts that are measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements. these instruments have
historically been categorized by us as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to an unobservable input associated with the credit valuation adjustment, which we deemed to be a significant
input to the overall measurement of fair value at inception. during 2012, this credit valuation adjustment has ceased to be a significant input to the entire fair value measurement of these
instruments. the remaining inputs which are significant to the fair value

measurement
of these instruments represent observable market inputs that are inputs other than quoted prices (level 2 inputs). 


 
 

our
policy is to recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy as of the beginning of the reporting period. due to the change in significance of the credit valuation
adjustment to the entire fair value measurement of these instruments, effective january 1, 2012, we have categorized our cross-currency interest rate contracts as level 2 within the fair
value hierarchy. 

gains
and losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) are
reported in interest expense and other comprehensive income (loss) as follows (dollars in millions):

we
also have assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets include property, plant and equipment and
those associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill and intangible assets. for these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if one
or more is determined to be impaired. during 2012, we had no impairments related to these assets. during 2011, in connection with the restructuring of our textile effects segment we recorded a charge
of $53 million for the impairment of long-lived assets at our basel, switzerland manufacturing facility. 

17. employee benefit plans  

defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans  

our employees participate in a trusteed, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the "plan") that covers
substantially all of our full-time u.s. employees. effective july 1, 2004, the plan formula for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement was converted to a cash
balance design. for represented employees, participation in the cash balance design is subject to the terms of negotiated contracts. for participating employees, benefits accrued under the prior
formula were converted to opening cash balance accounts. the new cash balance benefit formula provides annual pay credits from 4% to 12% of eligible pay, depending on age and service, plus accrued

interest.
participants in the plan on july 1, 2004 may be eligible for additional annual pay credits from 1% to 8%, depending on their age and service as of that date, for up to five years. the
conversion to the cash balance plan did not have a significant impact on the accrued benefit liability, the funded status or ongoing pension expense. 

we
sponsor defined benefit plans in a number of countries outside of the u.s. the availability of these plans, and their specific design provisions, are consistent with local competitive
practices and regulations. 

we
also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, which provide medical and life insurance benefits. 


our
postretirement benefit plans provide a fully insured medicare part d plan including prescription drug benefits affected by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (the "act"). we cannot determine whether the medical benefits provided by our postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to those provided by the act. we do not
collect a subsidy and our net periodic postretirement benefits cost, and related benefit obligation, do not reflect an amount associated with the subsidy. 

on
march 23, 2010, president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act. on march 30, 2010, president obama signed into law a reconciliation
measure, the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010. the passage of this legislation has resulted in comprehensive reform of health care in the u.s. we do not believe that this will have
a significant impact on our financial position.

in
both 2012 and 2011, the health care trend rate used to measure the expected increase in the cost of benefits was assumed to be 7.5% decreasing to 5% after 2017. assumed health care
cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. a one-percent point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have

our
investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to pursue an investment plan that, over the long term, is expected to protect the funded status of the plan, enhance the real
purchasing power of plan assets, and not threaten the plan's ability to meet currently committed obligations. additionally, our investment strategy is to achieve returns on plan assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk. plan assets are invested in a broad range of investments. these investments are diversified in terms of domestic and international equities, both growth and value
funds, including small, mid and large capitalization equities; short-term and long-term debt securities; real estate; and cash and cash equivalents. the investments are further
diversified within each asset category. the portfolio diversification provides protection against a single investment or asset category having a disproportionate impact on the aggregate performance of
the plan assets. 

our
pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers. the investment managers value our plan assets using quoted market prices, other observable inputs or unobservable
inputs. for certain assets, the investment managers obtain third-party appraisals at least annually, which use valuation techniques and inputs specific to the applicable property, market, or
geographic location. during 2012, there was a net transfer out of level 3 assets of $7 million due to a change in the

significance
of unobservable inputs for several investments, which are immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. these assets are all contained within the real estate/other category. 

we
have established target allocations for each asset category. our pension plan assets are periodically rebalanced based upon our target allocations. 


the
fair value of plan assets for the pension plans was $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the following plan assets are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in millions):

equity
securities in our pension plans did not include any equity securities of our company or our affiliates at the end of 2012. 


defined contribution plans  

we have a money purchase pension plan covering substantially all of our domestic employees who were hired prior to january 1,
2004. employer contributions are made based on a percentage of employees' earnings (ranging up to 8%). 

we
also have a salary deferral plan covering substantially all u.s. employees. plan participants may elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their
compensation. we contribute an amount equal to one-half of the participant's contribution, not to exceed 2% of the participant's compensation. 


along
with the introduction of the cash balance formula within our defined benefit pension plan, the money purchase pension plan was closed to new hires. at the same time, our match in
the salary deferral plan was increased, for new hires, to a 100% match, not to exceed 4% of the participant's compensation, once the participant has achieved six years of service with our company. 

our
total combined expense for the above defined contribution plans for each of the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $14 million. 


supplemental salary deferral plan and supplemental executive retirement plan  

the huntsman supplemental savings plan ("huntsman ssp") is a non-qualified plan covering key management employees and
allows participants to defer amounts that would otherwise be paid as compensation. the participant can defer up to 75% of their salary and bonus each year. this plan also provides benefits that would
be provided under the huntsman salary deferral plan if that plan were not subject to legal limits on the amount of contributions that can be allocated to an individual in a single year. the huntsman
ssp was amended and restated effective as of january 1, 2005 to allow eligible executive employees to comply with section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986. 


the
huntsman supplemental executive retirement plan (the "serp") is an unfunded non-qualified pension plan established to provide certain executive employees with benefits
that could not be provided, due to legal limitations, under the huntsman defined benefit pension plan, a qualified defined benefit pension plan, and the huntsman money purchase pension plan, a
qualified money purchase pension plan. 

assets
of these plans are included in other noncurrent assets and as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 were $14 million and $12 million, respectively. during each of the
years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 we expensed a total of $1 million as contributions to the huntsman ssp and the serp. 

stock-based incentive plan  

in connection with the initial public offering of common and preferred stock on february 16, 2005, we adopted the huntsman stock
incentive plan (the "stock incentive plan"). the stock incentive plan permits the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights,

18. income taxes (continued) 

on
september 8, 2009, we announced the closure of our australia styrenics operations. u.s. tax law, under our relevant facts, provides for a deduction on investments that are
"worthless" for u.s. tax purposes. therefore, during 2012, 2011, and 2010, we recorded tax benefits of $3 million, $2 million and
$28 million, respectively, in discontinued operations related to the closure of and the cumulative u.s. investments in our australia styrenics business. 

we
operate in 42 non-u.s. tax jurisdictions, and there is no specific country where our operations earn a predominant amount of our off-shore earnings. while the
vast majority of these countries have income tax rates that are lower than the u.s. statutory rate, the operating losses we incur in some of our non-u.s. jurisdictions mitigate the amount
of tax rate benefit we would otherwise realize from these tax rate differentials. 


during
2012, we were granted a tax holiday for the period from january 1, 2012 through december 31, 2016 with respect to certain income from products manufactured by our
pigments segment in malaysia. we are required to make certain investments in order to enjoy the benefits of the tax holiday, and we intend to make these investments.

we
have net operating loss carryforwards ("nols") of $2,893 million in various non-u.s. jurisdictions. while the majority of the non-u.s. nols have no
expiration date, $1,327 million have a limited life (of which $1,127 million are subject to a valuation allowance) and $17 million are scheduled to expire in 2013 (all of which
are subject to a valuation allowance). we had no nols expire unused in 2012. 

included
in the $2,893 million of non-u.s. nols is $860 million attributable to our luxembourg entities. as of december 31, 2012, there is a valuation
allowance of $222 million against these net tax-effected nols of $247 million. due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the benefits of these losses, we have
reduced substantially all of the related deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance. 

valuation
allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in
judgment about the

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued) 

18. income taxes (continued) 

realizability
of the related deferred tax assets. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of
businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for
the future. 

during
2012, we released valuation allowances of $24 million on a portion of our net deferred tax assets in china, in certain u.s. states and in luxembourg, and we established
valuation allowances of $23 million on certain net deferred tax assets in the u.s., india and indonesia. 

primarily
as a result of a cumulative history of operating profits, we released certain valuation allowances in china and in certain u.s. state tax jurisdictions of $9 million and
$2 million, respectively. additionally, a partial valuation allowance release was recognized in luxembourg for $12 million as a result of significant changes in estimated future taxable
income resulting from changed circumstances. 

during
2012, we amended certain prior year u.s. federal income tax filings and claimed $31 million of additional u.s. foreign tax credits. due to uncertainty regarding our ability
to actually utilize these credits before they expire in 2015, we established a partial valuation allowance of $21 million against the incremental deferred tax asset. 

during
2011, we released valuation allowances of $27 million on certain net deferred tax assets in france and spain (as a result of recent profitability in our pigments business),
singapore (as a result of a cumulative history of operating profits), australia (as a result of discontinuing the unprofitable portion of the business operations in that country) and luxembourg (as a
result of restructuring our internal treasury activities such that a portion of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized). during 2010, we released valuation allowances of
$20 million on certain net deferred tax assets, principally in australia (as a result of discontinuing the unprofitable portion of the business operations in that country) and luxembourg (as a
result of restructuring our internal treasury activities such that a portion of the deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized). 


uncertainties
regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions and result in additional valuation

18. income taxes (continued) 

certain
of our u.s. and non-u.s. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities and the amounts ultimately agreed upon in
resolution of the issues raised may differ materially from the amounts accrued. 


we
estimate that it is reasonably possible that certain of our non-u.s. unrecognized tax benefits could change within 12 months of the reporting date with a resulting
decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits within a reasonably possible range of $1 million to $19 million. for the 12-month period from the reporting date, we would expect
that a substantial portion of the decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits would result in no corresponding benefit to our income tax expense. 

during
2012, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, hong
kong, thailand and japan. during 2011, we concluded and effectively settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but
not limited to, australia, china, france and germany. during 2010, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s.
jurisdictions including, but not limited to, belgium, spain, indonesia, thailand and the u.k. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as
earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently invested
were approximately $215 million at december 31, 2012. it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings. we have material inter-company debt
obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation and our
ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of inter-company debt owned by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend, we expect to utilize our inter-company debt. if any earnings were repatriated via dividend, we would need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions.

19. commitments and contingencies  


purchase commitments  

we have various purchase commitments extending through 2023 for materials, supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of
business. included in the purchase commitments table below are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2012.
certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period,
such notice period has been included in the table below. the contractual purchase prices for substantially all of these contracts are variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations.
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our 2012 pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is
purchased. we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for each of the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we made minimum payments of
nil under such take or pay contracts without taking the property.

purchase commitments as of december 31, 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions):

legal matters  

asbestos litigation  

we have been named as a "premises defendant" in a number of asbestos exposure cases, typically claims by nonemployees of exposure to
asbestos while at a facility. in the past, these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants, and the complaints have not indicated which plaintiffs
were making claims against which defendants, where or how the alleged injuries occurred or what injuries each plaintiff claimed. these facts, which would be central to any estimate of probable loss,
generally have been learned only through discovery. 

where
a claimant's alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership of the relevant "premises," the prior owners generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for, and to
indemnify us against, asbestos exposure claims. this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations. upon service of a complaint in one of these cases, we tender it to the
prior owner. rarely do the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought. the prior owner accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any
amounts due to the claimants. in our nineteen-year experience with tendering these cases, we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases. we believe that the
prior owners have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnity obligations, although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these
cases if they do not.

(1)although
the indemnifying party informs us when tendered cases have been resolved, it generally does not inform us of the settlement amounts relating to
such cases, if any. the indemnifying party has informed us that it typically manages our defense together with the defense of other entities in such cases and resolves claims involving multiple
defendants simultaneously, and that it considers the allocation of settlement amounts, if any, among defendants to be confidential and proprietary. consequently, we are not able to provide the number
of cases resolved with payment by the indemnifying party or the amount of such payments. 
 
we
have never made any payments with respect to these cases. as of december 31, 2012, we had an accrued liability of approximately $10 million relating to these cases and a
corresponding receivable of approximately $10 million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases. we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or
that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; accordingly, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of
loss in excess of our accruals. additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future, and such claims could be material. however, because we are not able to estimate the amount or
range of losses associated with such claims, we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december 31, 2012. 

certain
cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators. however, we may be entitled to insurance or other recoveries in some
of these cases. the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about these cases. cases include all cases for which service has been received by us. certain prior cases
that were filed in error against us have been dismissed.

we
paid gross settlement costs for asbestos exposure cases that are not subject to indemnification of $559,000, $584,000 and $201,000 during the years ended december 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010,
respectively. as of december 31, 2012, we had no accrual relating to these cases. we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with
these cases would not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; accordingly, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our accruals.
additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future, and such claims could be material. however, because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses associated with
such claims, we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december 31, 2012. 

antitrust matters  

we have been named as a defendant in two class action civil antitrust suits filed on february 9 and 12, 2010 in the u.s.
district court for the district of maryland alleging that we and our co-defendants and other co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the u.s.
between at least march 1, 2002 and the present. the suits were subsequently consolidated. the other defendants named in this matter are dupont, kronos and millennium. on august 28, 2012,
the court certified a class consisting of all u.s. customers who purchased titanium dioxide directly from defendants since february 1, 2003, and notice was given to putative class members the
week of january 14, 2013 after the court of appeals for the fourth circuit denied our petition to appeal the order certifying the class. trial is set to begin september 9, 2013. 

the
plaintiffs seek to recover on behalf of the class injunctive relief, treble damages, costs of suit and attorneys fees. we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our
employees. nevertheless, we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts material to us. because of the overall complexity of these cases, we are unable to
reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss with respect to these claims. 

product delivery claim  

we have been notified by a customer of potential claims related to our allegedly delivering a different product from that which it had
ordered. our customer claims that it was unaware that the different product had been delivered until after it had been used to manufacture materials which were subsequently sold. originally, the
customer stated that it had been notified of claims of up to an aggregate of €153 million (approximately $202 million) relating to this matter and believed that we may be
responsible for all or a portion of these potential claims. our customer has since resolved some of these claims and the aggregate amount of the current claims is now approximately
€113 million (approximately $149 million). based on the facts currently available to us, we believe that we are insured for any liability we may ultimately have in excess
of $10 million. however, no assurance can be given regarding our ultimate liability or costs to us. we believe the range of possible loss to our company in this matter to be between
€0 and €113 million and have made no accrual with respect to this matter.

indemnification matter  

on july 3, 2012, deutsche bank securities inc. and credit suisse securities (usa) llc, or the banks, demanded that
we indemnify them for claims brought by certain matlinpatterson entities that were formerly our shareholders, the plaintiffs, in litigation filed june 19, 2012 in the 9th district court
in montgomery county, texas. the banks assert that they are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the agreement of compromise and settlement between the banks and our company, dated june 22,
2009, wherein the banks and our company settled claims that we brought relating to the failed merger with hexion. the plaintiffs claim that the banks knowingly made materially false representations
about the nature of the financing for the acquisition of our company by hexion and that they suffered substantial losses to their 19 million shares of our common stock as a result of the banks'
misrepresentations. the plaintiffs are asserting statutory fraud, common law fraud and aiding and abetting statutory fraud and are seeking actual damages, exemplary damages, costs and attorney's fees,
pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. we denied the banks' indemnification demand. on december 21, 2012, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, and the appeal
deadline is 90 days after entry of the order. the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration before the trial court on january 18, 2013. 

other proceedings  

we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under
provisions of applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these
matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

20. environmental, health and safety matters  

environmental, health and safety matters  

general  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety,
pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
waste materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in
addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws,
environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some
environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to
modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities.

20. environmental, health and safety matters (continued)  


environmental, health and safety systems  

we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable ehs legal requirements, and we have developed policies and
management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, ensure the safety of our
employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are
frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 


ehs capital expenditures  

we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and
repair pollution control equipment. for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled $105 million, $92 million, and
$85 million, respectively. because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of
specific requirements, our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future
amounts we may spend related to ehs and other applicable laws. 

remediation liabilities  

we have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former
facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the
purchase of our businesses. under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 

under
cercla and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous
substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. outside
the u.s., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in france and australia, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. currently, there are
approximately 10 former facilities or third-party sites in the u.s. for which we have been notified of potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed
under cercla. based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites, we do not expect these third-party claims to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


one
of these sites, the north maybe canyon mine site, involves a former phosphorous mine near soda springs, idaho, which is believed to have been operated by a predecessor company to us.
in 2004, the u.s. forest service notified us that we are a cercla prp for contaminated surface water at the site. in february 2010, we and wells cargo (another prp) agreed to conduct a remedial

investigation/feasibility
study of a portion of the site and are currently engaged in that process. at this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate our potential liabilities at this site. 


in
addition, under rcra and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit. some of our
manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. we are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from
past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. for example, our port neches, texas, and geismar, louisiana, facilities are the subject of ongoing
remediation requirements imposed under rcra. similar laws exist in a number of locations in which
we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing facilities, such as australia, india, france, hungary and italy. 


by
letter dated march 7, 2006, our former base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray, australia, was issued a clean-up notice by epa victoria due to
concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. on august 23, 2010, epa victoria revoked the second clean-up notice and issued a revised notice that
included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation. we have reached agreement with the agency that a mortgage on the land will be held by the agency as financial surety during the
period covered by the current clean-up notice, which ends on july 30, 2014. as of december 31, 2012, we had an accrued liability of $29 million related to estimated
environmental remediation costs at this site. we can provide no assurance that the agency will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be
associated with the clean up. 

environmental reserves  

we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known
penalties. liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimates are calculated using present value
techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. the environmental liabilities do not include amounts
recorded as asset retirement obligations. we had accrued $34 million and $36 million for environmental liabilities as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. of these
amounts, $10 million and $7 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and
$24 million and $29 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. in certain cases,
our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to
estimate the amount or range of such potential excess. 

regulatory developments  

the eu regulatory framework for chemicals, called "reach", became effective in 2007 and is designed to be phased in gradually over
11 years. as a reach-regulated company that manufactures in or imports more than one metric ton per year of a chemical substance into the european economic area, we were required to
pre-register with the echa, such chemical substances and isolated

to take advantage of the 11 year phase-in period. to meet our compliance obligations, a cross-business reach team was established, through which we were able to
fulfill all required pre-registrations and our first phase registrations by the november 30, 2010 deadline. while we continue our registration efforts to meet the next registration
deadline of may 31, 2013, our reach implementation team is now strategically focused on the authorization phase of the reach process, directing its efforts to address "substances of very high
concern" and evaluating potential business implications. where warranted, evaluation of substitute chemicals will be an important element of our ongoing manufacturing sustainability efforts. as a
chemical manufacturer with global operations, we are also actively monitoring and addressing analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the eu, e.g. korea and
taiwan. 

although
the total long-term cost for reach compliance is unknown at this time, we spent approximately $8 million, $5 million and $9 million in 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively, to meet the initial reach requirements. we cannot provide assurance that these recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts that we may be required to spend for
reach compliance. 

greenhouse gas regulation  

globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and
methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the most recent negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol, a limited group of nations, including the
eu, agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the european union ghg emissions trading
system, established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the eu, has just entered its third phase and ongoing reforms at the eu level—including measures to prop up
carbon credit prices and ban the use of certain types of certified emission reductions—may increase our operating costs. australia has also adopted a carbon trading system that has been
recognized for formal linkage with the eu trading system by 2018. australia's ghg cap-and-trade program may impose compliance obligations upon our operations that may increase
our operating costs. in the united states, california has commenced the first compliance period of its cap-and-trade program. 

federal
climate change legislation in the united states appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will be led by the epa's ghg
regulations and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or
expanded facilities. expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act's prevention of significant deterioration requirements under the epa's
ghg
"tailoring rule." our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and the collection and reporting of ghg data may increase our operational costs. 

under
a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the epa is due to propose new source performance standards (nsps) for ghg emissions from refineries. these standards could
significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. either of these events could have an
adverse effect on our business.

20. environmental, health and safety matters (continued) 


we
are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and/or eu emissions trading
scheme requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible
that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and/or increases in
energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on
any of our sites. 

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical
effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and
operations. 

port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the doj
notified us that we were in violation of the caa based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the enforcement initiative to bring similar actions
against refiners and other chemical manufacturers. specifically, the epa alleged violations of flare operations at our port neches, texas facility from 2007-2012 against us that were not
consistent with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these findings, epa referred this matter to the doj. we have been engaged
in discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these violations and are in the process of reviewing their allegations and assessing their claims. we are
currently unable to determine the likelihood or magnitude of potential penalty or injunctive relief that may be incurred in resolving this matter. 

21. huntsman corporation stockholders' equity  

share repurchase program  

effective august 5, 2011, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $100 million in shares of our
common stock. repurchases under this program may be made through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior
notice. shares of common stock acquired through the repurchase program are held in treasury at cost. during 2011, we acquired approximately four million shares of our outstanding common stock for
approximately $50 million under the repurchase program. during 2012, we did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock under the repurchase program. as of december 31,
2012, there remained approximately $50 million of the amount authorized under the program that could be used for stock repurchases.

22. stock-based compensation plan  


under the stock incentive plan, a plan approved by stockholders, we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, phantom stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock
options may be granted solely to employees. the terms of the grants are fixed at the grant date. as of december 31, 2012 we were authorized to grant up to 32.6 million shares under the
stock incentive plan. as of december 31, 2012, we had 8 million shares remaining under the stock incentive plan available for grant. option awards have a maximum contractual term of
10 years and generally must have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of our common stock on the date the option award is granted. stock- based awards generally vest over a
three-year period.

total income tax benefit recognized in the statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements was $6 million, $6 million and $8 million for the
years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

the
fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. expected
volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock through the grant date. the expected term of options granted was estimated based on the contractual term of the instruments and
employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the u.s.
treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the assumptions noted below represent the weighted averages of the assumptions utilized for all stock options granted during the year.

on
july 12, 2007, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with hexion (the "hexion merger agreement"). on june 18, 2008, hexion, apollo and certain of their
affiliates filed an action in delaware chancery court seeking to terminate the hexion merger. we countersued hexion and apollo in the delaware chancery court and filed a separate action against apollo
and certain of its affiliates in the district court of montgomery county, texas. on december 13, 2008, we terminated the hexion merger agreement and, on december 14, 2008, we entered
into the apollo settlement agreement to settle the terminated merger-related litigation and certain other related matters. pursuant to the apollo settlement agreement, hexion and certain apollo
affiliates have paid us an aggregate of $1 billion. 

on
september 30, 2008, we filed suit in the 9th judicial district court in montgomery county, texas against the banks that had entered into a commitment letter to provide
funding for the hexion merger. on june 22, 2009, we entered into the texas bank litigation settlement agreement with such banks. this litigation was dismissed with prejudice on june 23,
2009. in accordance with the texas bank litigation settlement agreement, the banks paid us a cash payment of $632 million, purchased the $600 million aggregate principal amount 5.50%
2016 senior notes from huntsman international, and provided huntsman international with term loan c in the principal amount of $500 million. the 2016 senior notes and term loan c borrowings
were at favorable rates to us and were recorded at a
combined fair value of $864 million. accordingly, we recognized a gain of $868 million in connection with the texas bank litigation settlement agreement. on september 21, 2010,
the board of directors approved bonuses totaling $3 million to certain members of the board of directors, upon the recommendation of an independent committee of the board of directors, for
their efforts in connection with the litigation with hexion and apollo following the terminated merger.

during the first quarter of 2010, we ceased operation of our former australian styrenics business. during 2010, we recorded additional
closure costs of $6 million. also during 2010, we recorded a $19 million loss from the recognition of cumulative currency translation losses upon the liquidation and substantial
liquidation of foreign entities related to this business. furthermore, we recorded an additional tax benefit of $28 million in 2010 related to the closure of this business. the following

in
2006, product defect actions were filed against hcca in australian courts relating to the sale and supply of vinyl ester resins that were used in the manufacture of fiberglass
swimming pools. hcca ceased manufacturing these specific resin formulations by 2004 and sold the business that manufactured and sold these resins in 2007. 

during
the first quarter of 2011, hcca increased its estimate of probable loss related to these claims and recorded a liability for the full estimated value of the claims and a
corresponding receivable relating to our indemnity protection with a net charge to discontinued operations for any potential shortfall in insurance coverage. following mediation held in august 2011,
hcca and its insurers reached an agreement with two claimants to settle their claims for amounts within our insurance coverage after our self-insured retention was satisfied. accordingly,
during the third quarter of 2011, hcca reduced its estimate of probable loss proportionately and reversed a portion of the liability related to this matter. the settlements were paid in the fourth
quarter of 2011. 

the
results of our former australian styrenics business were previously included in our corporate and other segment and have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 

u.s. base chemicals business  

on november 5, 2007, we completed a disposition of our u.s. base chemicals businesses, which included our former olefins
manufacturing assets located at port arthur, texas. a captive ethylene unit at the retained port neches, texas site of our performance products segment operations was not included in the sale. this
asset, along with a long-term post-closing arrangement for the supply of ethylene and propylene from flint hills resources to us, will continue to provide feedstock for our
downstream derivative units.

during
2010, we recorded a $110 million pretax gain in connection with the final settlement of insurance claims related to the 2006 fire at our former port arthur, texas plant and
a pretax gain of $7 million from the settlement of insurance claims related to the 2005 gulf coast storms. of the $110 million payment, $34 million was reflected within the
statement of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and the remaining $76 million was reflected as cash flows from operating activities. the results of our former u.s. base
chemicals business are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. these 2010 insurance settlement gains were offset in part by income taxes and legal fees related to the
arbitration of the fire insurance claim.

pursuant
to an agreement entered into in 2001, our subsidiary airstar corporation ("airstar") subleases a gulfstream iv-sp aircraft (the "aircraft") from jstar corporation
("jstar"), a corporation wholly owned by jon m. huntsman. jon m. huntsman is the executive chairman and the father of our chief executive officer, peter r. huntsman, and our
director, jon m. huntsman, jr. in 2011, this arrangement was extended for an additional 10 year period. in connection with this extension, monthly sublease payments from airstar to jstar
were reduced from approximately $193,000 to approximately $115,000 and an aggregate of $13.8 million is payable through the end of the current 10 year lease term. these monthly sublease
payments are used to fund financing costs paid by jstar to a leasing company. an unrelated third party pays $2.4 million per year to our subsidiary for such third party's part-time
use of the aircraft (or an alternate owned by us if the aircraft is unavailable), subject to an annual adjustment, which typically has been at least fair market value for the number of flight hours

26. related party transactions (continued) 

used
by such third party. we bear all other costs of operating the aircraft. in accordance with our aircraft use policy, we have entered into aircraft time-sharing agreements with certain
members of the huntsman family, pursuant to which these persons pay for the costs of any personal use of the aircraft by them. 

an
agreement was reached prior to the initial public offering of our common stock in february 2005 with the huntsman foundation, a private charitable foundation established by
jon m. and karen h. huntsman, to further the charitable interests of the huntsman family, that we would donate our salt lake city office building and our option to acquire an adjacent
undeveloped parcel of land to the foundation free of debt. on march 24, 2010, we completed this donation. at the time of the donation, the building had an appraised value of approximately
$10 million. we continue to occupy and use a portion of the building under a lease pursuant to which we make annual lease payments of approximately $2 million to the huntsman foundation.
during both 2012 and 2011, we made payments of approximately $2 million to the huntsman foundation under the lease. the lease expires on december 31, 2013, subject to two
five-year extensions, at our option. 

through
may 2002, we paid the premiums on various life insurance policies for jon m. huntsman. these policies have been liquidated, and the cash values have been paid to
mr. huntsman. mr. huntsman is indebted to us in the amount of approximately $2 million, which represents the insurance premiums paid on his behalf through may 2002. this amount is
included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

27. operating segment information

27. operating segment information (continued)  


sales between segments are generally recognized at external market prices and are eliminated in consolidation. we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our global business
units and for reporting the results of our operating segments. this measure includes all operating items relating to the businesses. the ebitda of operating segments excludes items that principally
apply to our company as a whole. the revenues and ebitda for each of our reportable operating segments are as follows (dollars in millions):

(1)during
2012, our polyurethanes segment implemented a restructuring program to reduce annualized fixed costs by $75 million by the third quarter of
2013. in connection with this program, we recorded restructuring expenses of $5 million, $32 million and $1 million in the first, third and fourth quarters of 2012, respectively.
(2)during
the fourth quarter of 2012, our advanced materials segment began implementing a global transformational change program, subject to consultation with
relevant employee representatives, designed to improve the segment's manufacturing efficiencies, enhance commercial excellence and ensure its long-term global competitiveness. in
connection with this global transformational change program, we recorded charges of $28 million related primarily to workforce reduction costs.  


also
during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $77 million in connection with the redemption of $400 million of our 2016 senior notes. 

(3)basic
and diluted income per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during that period. therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share.
(4)during
the quarter ended september 30, 2011, we announced plans to implement a significant restructuring of our textile effects business, including
the closure of our production facilities and business support offices in basel, switzerland. in connection with this plan during 2011, we recorded a charge of $62 million for workforce
reduction and a noncash $53 million charge for the impairment of long-lived assets at our basel, switzerland manufacturing facility.
(5)during
the quarter ended december 31, 2011, our advanced materials division completed the sale of its stereolithography resin and
digitalis® machine manufacturing businesses to 3d systems corporation and recognized a pre-tax gain of $34 million.
