table of contentspolyurethanesgeneralwe are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including mdi products, polyols, and tpu (each discussed in more detail below under “—products and markets”). polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. we focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for specialty mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. volume growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. we operate five primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. we also operate 29 strategically located downstream facilities, 25 of them are polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as “systems houses,” located in close proximity to our customers worldwide, which enables us to focus on customer support, technical service and a differentiated product offering. we also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing facility focused on the insulation market and three downstream tpu manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china.our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as mdi, with polyols, which are derived largely from po and eo. we are able to produce over 2,500 distinct mdi-based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations. as a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from mdi, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, coatings, adhesives, wood binders for construction and furniture, footwear and other specialized engineering applications.in 1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china. we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethane formulations facility and a world-scale research and development campus. in january 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai, china in caojing. in june 2006, hps, a consolidated joint venture, began production at our mdi finishing plant. in september 2006, slic, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at the mnb, aniline and crude mdi plants. we completed capacity expansions of these facilities during the first quarter of 2018. these world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market, the largest mdi market in the world, and will support the long-term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. additionally, in november 2012, we entered into an agreement with sinopec to form a joint venture to build a world scale po/mtbe plant in nanjing, china utilizing proprietary po/mtbe manufacturing technology. the facility was completed in early 2017 and beneficial commercial operations began in the second half of 2017. we own a 49% interest in the joint venture and account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment. 4
table of contentsproducts and marketsmdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with mdi in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. we produce mdi, polyols and tpu products and do not produce tdi products.polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. depending on their needs, customers will use either component polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. by varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products.our strategy is focused on growing our differentiated product offering (specialty mdi and polyols, formulated mdi systems and tpu), which requires a greater emphasis on formulating capability to help our downstream customers to meet the desired effect required in their applications. these differentiated products tend to require technical solutions, offer higher margins, lower volatility and are less dependent on industry utilization rates compared to sales of component mdi or component polyols.mdi.  mdi has grown substantially over the past three decades, increasing by a factor of 6% cagr, well in excess of global gdp. mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane isocyanates. this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. we believe that mdi and formulated mdi systems, which combine mdi and polyols, will continue to grow at approximately double the rate of global gdp driven by the mega trends of energy management, food preservation, demographics and urbanization/transportation. mdi offers key products benefits of energy efficiency, comfort and durability aligned with these megatrends. we believe that mdi and formulated mdi systems will continue to substitute for alternative materials such as fiberglass in insulation, phenol formaldehyde in wood binders and tdi in automotive and furniture. specialty cushioning and insulation applications, thermoplastic polyurethanes and adhesives and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi. mdi experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. ​tpu.  tpu is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to help meet the specific 5
table of contentsrequirements of our customers. tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. it is also extruded into films for apparel, wires and cables for industrial use and in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets.polyols.  polyols are combined with mdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of formulated polyurethane systems. demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown.aniline.  aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi. the majority of our aniline is consumed internally with some sold to third parties. we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract.our strategic focus is on growing our differentiated (specialty mdi and polyols, formulated mdi-based systems and tpu) product offerings and the diagram below provides an overview of that focus with an approximation of the number of grades, formulations, products and stock keeping units which we produce and sell. ​​sales and marketingwe market our polyurethane chemicals to over 6,000 customers in more than 90 countries. our sales, marketing and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets and key end-use markets, some of which require a coordinated global approach, such as key accounts across the automotive sector. these key end-use markets include the commercial and residential insulation, appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. we sell both directly and indirectly to customers, the latter via a network of distributors and agents who in turn sell our products to customers who cannot be served as cost effectively by our internal sales groups.we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of “systems” in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers. our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support, which can be tailored for the needs of our customers, is critical to our long-term success. we have strategically located our downstream polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. we believe this customer support and 6
table of contentstechnical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers.our strategy is to grow the number and capability of our downstream facilities both organically and inorganically. as a result, we have made a number of “bolt-on” acquisitions in recent years to expand our downstream footprint and align with our strategic intent.we believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. our sales strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service.manufacturing and operationsour world-scale mdi production facilities are located in geismar, louisiana; rotterdam, the netherlands; and through our joint ventures in caojing, china. these facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of mdi, from our facilities located in geismar, louisiana; wilton, u.k.; and caojing, china. we believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities is necessary to provide cost competitiveness in mdi production. the following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at select polyurethanes facilities: ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​    mdi    polyols    tpu    aniline    nitrobenzene    ​​(millions of pounds)​caojing, china 825(1) ​          geismar, louisiana 1,060  160     706(2)  1,000(2) houston, texas     168          jinshan, china        44       osnabrück, germany     26  59       ringwood, illinois        28       rotterdam, the netherlands 1,036  190          wilton, u.k.           783  1,045 total 2,921  544  131  1,489  2,045 (1)    represents our share of capacity from slic.(2)    represents our approximately 78% share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with lanxess ag.​at our geismar, rotterdam and caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce mdi. this technology contributes to our position as a low-cost mdi producer. joint venturesrubicon joint venture.  lanxess ag (“lanxess”) is our joint venture partner in rubicon llc, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa manufacturing facilities in geismar, louisiana. we are entitled to approximately 78% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc, and lanxess is entitled to 100% of the dpa production. in addition to operating the joint venture’s aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa facilities, rubicon llc operates our wholly-owned mdi, polyol and maleic anhydride facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex. as a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements.chinese mdi joint ventures.  we are involved in two related joint ventures which operate mdi production facilities in caojing, china. slic, our manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies, produces mnb, aniline and crude mdi. we effectively own 35% of slic and account for our investment under the equity method. hps, our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd, manufactures pure mdi, polymeric mdi, mdi variants and formulated mdi systems. we own 70% of hps and it is consolidated in our financial statements. these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners 7

table of contentsbelgium; and shanghai, china. other regional development/technical service centers are located in auburn hills, michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); derry, new hampshire, shanghai, china, deggendorf, germany and ternate, italy (polyurethanes); basel, switzerland and panyu, china (advanced materials and textile effects); and mumbai, india (textile effects).intellectual property rightsproprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. we own approximately 2,830 unexpired patents and have approximately 1,010 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending. while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued u.s. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner.we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. there can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. in addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.in addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. we also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties.we have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 4,110 trademark registrations and 190 pending trademark applications globally. these registrations and applications include extensions of protection under the madrid system for the international registration of marks. however, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted.because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.employeesas of december 31, 2019, we employed approximately 10,000 associates in our operations around the world, including approximately 1,000 employees associated with the chemical intermediates businesses that was sold on january 3, 2020. approximately 3,000 of these employees are located in the u.s., while approximately 7,000 are located in other countries. environmental, health and safety mattersgeneralwe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether. in addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our 18
table of contentsoperations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. information related to environmental, health and safety (“ehs”) matters may also be found in other areas of this report including “—item 1a. risk factors,” “note 2. summary of significant accounting policies—environmental expenditures” to our consolidated financial statements and “note 22. environmental health and safety matters” to our consolidated financial statements.environmental, health and safety systemswe are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable ehs legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. we cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage ehs legal requirements without incurring substantial costs. although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us.environmental remediationwe have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources.in cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. we cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters.based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. however, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. at the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate contaminated sites.regulatory mattersgreenhouse gas regulation and climate changeglobally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“ghgs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. at the durban negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the european union (the “eu”), agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the eu ghg emissions trading system (“ets”), established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the eu, continues in its third phase. the eu parliament has used a process to formalize “backloading”—the withholding of ghg allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices. as backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ets. to that end, the european commission established a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience that started operating in 2019. in addition, the eu has announced the binding target to reduce domestic ghg emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. the eu has set a binding target of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the eu’s energy consumption by 2030, and additional proposals have been made to increase the target to 35%.in addition, at the 2015 united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, the u.s. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which went into effect in november 2016 (the “paris 19
table of contentsagreement”). although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their ghg emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. however, in august 2017 the u.s. informed the united nations that it is withdrawing from the paris agreement. the paris agreement provides for a four-year exit process, which would result in an effective exit date of november 2020. the united states’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the united states may re-enter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. additionally, in response to the united states’ withdrawal announcement, various corporations, investors, and u.s. state and local governments have publicly pledged to further the goals of the paris agreement.domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions are being led by the u.s. environmental protection agency’s (the “epa”) ghg regulations and similar programs of certain states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa’s ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act’s (the “caa”) requirements for pollutants regulated under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs. some of our facilities are also subject to the epa’s mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs.we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to u.s. federal and state requirements, kyoto protocol obligations and/or ets requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.available informationwe maintain an internet website at http://www.huntsman.com. our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file this material with the sec. we also provide electronic or paper copies of our sec filings free of charge upon request.glossary of chemical termsbdo—butane diolblr—base liquid resindga® agent—diglycolamine® agentdpa—diphenylamineedc—ethylene dichlorideeg—ethylene glycoleo—ethylene oxidemda—methylene dioxy amphetaminemdi—methyl diphenyl diisocyanatemnb—mononitrobenzenemtbe—methyl tertiary-butyl etherpbt—polybutylene terephthalatepo—propylene oxidepolyols—a substance containing several hydroxyl groups. a diol, triol and tetrol contain two, three and four hydroxyl groups, respectively.tdi—toluene diisocyanatetpu—thermoplastic polyurethaneupr—unsaturated polyester resin​20
table of contentsitem 1a.  risk factorsany of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.risks related to our businessour industry is affected by global economic factors, including risks associated with volatile economic conditions.our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the u.s., europe and asia. declining economic conditions in all or any of these locations—or negative perceptions about economic conditions—could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business. the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. as a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations. we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the industries in which we operate.disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds, outages and other disruptions. any serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. long-term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability.unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. for example, the recent emergence of a novel strain of coronavirus in the city of wuhan and the hubei province of china has resulted in certain emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including extension of the lunar new year holidays, implementation of travel bans and closure of factories and businesses. while the full impact of the outbreak is unknown at this time, we have restricted employee travel to china and idled our manufacturing facilities in the country as a safety precaution. any significant production disruption could have a material impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition.in addition, we rely on a number of vendors, suppliers, and in some cases sole-source suppliers, service providers, toll manufacturers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities that we need to operate our business. if the business of these third parties is disrupted, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. if this were to occur, it could adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products. moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change. in addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not available at all. furthermore, some potential climate-driven losses, particularly inundation due to sea-level rise, may pose long-term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be restored in their current locations.21
table of contentsthe markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products.the cyclicality that the markets for many of our products experience occurs as a result of alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of lower capacity utilization, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins. the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the demand for products as a consequence of global economic activity, changes in energy prices and changes in customers’ requirements. for example, demand for our products depends in part on the housing and construction industries, which are cyclical in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy. the supply-demand balance is also impacted by capacity additions or reductions that result in changes in utilization rates. the cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle.changes in u.s. trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers export, including among others, textile, automotive and consumer products, could cause the prices of our customers’ products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, our products may become directly subject to future tariffs, which would in turn raise the cost to our customers and could adversely affect the demand for our products. direct or unforeseen consequences of tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions may also alter the competitive landscape of our products in one or more regions of the world. it remains unclear how the u.s. administration or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies. for example, any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, or the failure to reach agreement over trade agreements, or the imposition of new or increased tariffs, or the more aggressive prosecution of trade disputes with countries like china, may increase costs or reduce profitability, or adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy. as result, a trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers' costs, demand for our customers’ products, and/or the global economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.​our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes.we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the u.s., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations. these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. we transact business in many foreign currencies, including euros, swiss francs, chinese renminbi, indian rupees, brazilian reals and thai bahts. we translate our local currency financial results into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer u.s. dollars. because we currently have significant operations located outside the u.s., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements.other risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, cash repatriation restrictions, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of u.s. and foreign laws, including monetary policies, tax laws, the foreign corrupt practices act (and foreign equivalents), export controls and regulations administered by the office of foreign assets control. any changes in tariffs or trade barriers could make our products less competitive compared to other producers not subject to the same tariffs or trade barriers. any decision to repatriate cash as dividends could subject us to foreign and u.s. federal and state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief. although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where legal processes may vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices 22
table of contentsvary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems. the occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us.we operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. in addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (“gaap” or “u.s. gaap”) have required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in certain tax jurisdictions. these valuation allowances result from analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions. changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. economic conditions or changes in tax laws may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new valuation allowances. while significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations. furthermore, certain foreign jurisdictions may take actions to delay our ability to collect value-added tax refunds.significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability.we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials from third-party suppliers and the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. for example, the market for crude oil and natural gas feedstocks experienced depressed pricing throughout the second half of 2018, leading to favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchase from third parties. lower raw material prices, however, can lead to downward pressure on selling prices for certain of our products leading to reduced revenue. our supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.in general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic chemical commodity products that are readily available at market prices. there are, however, several raw materials for which there are only a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier. to mitigate potential supply constraints, we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, evaluate alternative sources of supply and evaluate alternative technologies to avoid reliance on limited or sole-source suppliers. in addition, where supply relationships are concentrated, particular attention is paid by the parties to ensure strategic intentions are aligned to facilitate long-term planning. if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. the inability of a supplier to meet our raw material needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations.the number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is also specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located. political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability. in addition, if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost-effective substitutes. we may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect our profitability. we may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher production costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity.​our results of operations and equity method investment in venator may fluctuate significantly depending upon the changes in market value of venator shares.​in august 2017, we separated the p&a business through an ipo of ordinary shares of venator, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary. on december 3, 2018, we sold an aggregate of 4,334,389, or approximately 4%, of venator ordinary shares. following this transaction, we retained approximately 49% ownership in venator, and we elected the 23
table of contentsfair value option to account for our equity method investment in venator post deconsolidation, in which case the investment balance is marked to fair value each reporting period and the impact of changes in fair value of the equity method investment are reported in earnings. under this approach, our results of operations and equity method investment in venator could fluctuate significantly depending upon the changes in market value of venator common stock. specifically, the market price for venator’s ordinary shares has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price fluctuations. for example, during the year ended december 31, 2019, venator’s stock price ranged from a low of $1.85 to a high of $7.24. as result, the cyclicality and volatility of venator’s stock price can result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations and equity method investment from quarter to quarter.our efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.we continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change. these initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, restructuring our existing operations and assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new kinds of risks. we have incurred indebtedness to finance these opportunities, and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future initiatives. if our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted.the implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including:●diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations;●requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses;●disruptions to important business relationships;●increased operating costs;●limitations imposed by various governmental entities; and●difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter.​our inability to mitigate these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may fail to fully achieve the savings or growth projected for current or future initiatives notwithstanding the expenditure of substantial resources in pursuit thereof.we may have difficulties integrating acquired businesses and as a result, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.we have completed a number of acquisitions and we will continue to acquire additional businesses and enter into joint ventures as part of our business strategy. growth through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks, including:●inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses and products;●inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures;●unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business;●difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses;●difficulties in realizing projected synergies; ●inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses and products;●inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures;●unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business;●difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses;●difficulties in realizing projected synergies; and●exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability or illegal activities conducted by an acquired company or a joint venture partner.​24
table of contentsour inability to address these risks could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.​the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. among our competitors are some of the world’s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position in various products and markets throughout the world. some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development.while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive. moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.further, it is possible that we could abandon certain products, processes, or applications due to potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights or that we could be named in future litigation for the infringement or misappropriation of a competitor’s or other third party’s intellectual property rights, which could include a claim for injunctive relief and damages, and, if so, such adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, certain of our competitors in various countries in which we do business, including china, may be owned by or affiliated with members of local governments and political entities.these competitors may get special treatment with respect to regulatory compliance and product registration, while certain of our products, including those based on new technologies, may be delayed or even prevented from entering into the local market.certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of our business. the entrance of new competitors into any of our businesses may reduce our ability to maintain margins or capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand their roles significantly in the future. increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any technology disruption or cybersecurity incident could negatively affect our operations.​we rely on information technology systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain and financial information and various other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. our technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire, natural disasters, power outages, system failures, security breaches, espionage, cyber-attacks, viruses, theft and inadvertent release of information. any such disruption to these information technology systems could disrupt our operations or result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or employees which could result in negative publicity/brand damage, violation of privacy laws, potential liability, including litigation/investigation/remediation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. any or all the above would potentially cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions or reporting of financial results. while we have invested and will continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, we may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all the significant risks to our information technology systems. we have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of our 25
table of contentsoperations. current employees have, and former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our competitors or otherwise used to harm us. moreover, our operations in certain locations, such as china, may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems. any breach of our security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information, corruption of data or disruption of operations or transactions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we could be required to expend significant additional efforts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches.finally, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations in countries where we do business. for example, the eu adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, the general data protection regulation (“gdpr”), which requires companies to meet new regulations regarding the handling of personal data. our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the gdpr requirements could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability which could tarnish our reputation. ​agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or to obtain additional financing.​the agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants. these covenants may limit or prohibit our ability to among other things, incur additional indebtedness; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. some of our strategies may necessitate receiving consents or waivers under our debt arrangements, which could be withheld.our failure to comply with any of our debt covenants, or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt, could result in a default, or trigger cross-default or acceleration provisions, under our debt agreements. an event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, cause our creditors to terminate their lending commitments. any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. for more information regarding our debt covenants, see “note 15. debt—compliance with covenants” to our consolidated financial statements.our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability.​although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical and other products. these hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. we are also potentially subject to other hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. in addition, some equipment and operations at our facilities are owned or controlled by third parties who may not be fully integrated into our safety programs and over whom we are able to exercise limited control. many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers’ compensation and other matters.we maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.in addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. for more information, see “—item 3. legal proceedings” below.26
table of contentswe are subject to many ehs regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. actual or alleged violations of ehs laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some ehs laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.many of our products and operations are subject to the chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. these laws include the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the toxic substances control act (“tsca”) in the u.s. and the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals (“reach”) and the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (“clp”) regulations in europe. analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including china, south korea, and taiwan. in addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the u.k., have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for these rules.additional new laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. for example, in the u.s., the epa finalized revisions to its risk management program in january 2017. the revisions include new requirements for certain facilities to perform hazard analyses, third-party auditing, incident investigations and root cause analyses, emergency response exercises, and to publicly share chemical and process information. the epa proposed to delay the rule’s effect until february 2019; however, a ruling by the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit on september 21, 2018 made the risk management program rule amendment effective immediately. the epa finalized a reconsideration rule on november 20, 2019 that rescinded several of the 2017 revisions to the risk management program rule. the u.s. occupational safety and health administration had previously announced that it was considering changes to its process safety management standards that parallel epa’s risk management program; but additional action appears unlikely at this time. in addition, tsca reform legislation was enacted in june 2016, and the epa has begun the process of issuing new chemical control regulations. epa issued several final rules in 2017 and 2018 under the revised tsca related to existing chemicals, including the following: (i) a rule to establish epa’s process and criteria for identifying chemicals for risk evaluation; (ii) a rule to establish epa’s process for evaluating high priority chemicals and their uses to determine whether or not they present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment; and (iii) a rule to require industry reporting of chemicals manufactured or processed in the u.s. over the past 10 years. in april 2019, epa proposed a revision to its chemical data reporting rule under tsca, which would change reporting requirements. the epa has also released its framework for approving new chemicals and new uses of existing chemicals. under the framework, a new chemical or use presents an unreasonable risk if it exceeds set standards. such a finding could result in either the issuance of rules restricting the use of the chemical being evaluated or in the need for additional testing. the costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.furthermore, governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. in addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. moreover, changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. for example, several of our products are being evaluated under reach and clp regulations and actions thereunder could negatively impact sales.we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws. capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws.furthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials, or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. we may therefore incur additional 27
table of contentscosts and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws.regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. there are existing efforts to address ghg emissions at the international, national, and regional levels. for example, the 2015 paris climate summit agreement, which entered into force in november 2016, resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their ghg emissions. however, the u.s. notified the united nations in august 2017 that it will be withdrawing from the agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process. the eu also regulates ghgs under the eu ets and china has established its own country-wide ghg cap and trade program. domestically, the epa issued its final clean power plan rules in 2015 that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called co2 emission performance rates. this rule has been challenged in court and the epa announced in october 2017 that it intended to repeal and potentially replace the clean power plan. on august 21, 2018, the epa proposed the affordable clean energy (“ace”) rule to replace the 2015 clean power plan, which was stayed by the u.s. supreme court and has never gone into effect. in june 2019, epa finalized ace rule, which established emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address ghg emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. such rules and agreements may affect the long-term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. these various regulations and agreements may result in increased costs to purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of ghg emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use. compliance with these regulations and any more stringent restrictions in the future may increase our operational costs.in addition, most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. if any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws. capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws.furthermore, we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws.our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims against us, including antitrust claims.​we face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property and environmental claims. it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity, or which may be beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies. in this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek injunctive relief, treble damages or the maximum damages allowed by state law, costs of suit and attorneys’ fees, which may result in significant liabilities. an adverse outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition, liquidity and business reputation.our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers, customers and business partners and the industries in which our suppliers, customers and business partners participate are cyclical in nature, both of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.our business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business partners and reductions in demand for our customers’ products. during periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing 28
table of contentsour profitability. a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer.economic conditions and regulatory changes following the united kingdom's exit from the eu could adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition.​on january 31, 2020, the united kingdom (the "u.k.”) officially departed from the european union (“eu”) and entered into an implementation period. at the end of this 11-month implementation period, the u.k. will depart from the eu customs union and single market.  since june 2016, the uncertainty around the brexit triggered short-term and potentially long-term financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the pound sterling in comparison to both the u.s. dollar and euro, and its indirect effect on the relationship between the u.s. dollar and the euro. the future effects of brexit will depend on the final agreements the u.k. makes to retain access following the implementation period to the eu or other markets. given the lack of comparable precedent, it remains unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the u.k. from the eu would have and how such withdrawal would affect our company, although any increase in duties and tariffs between the u.k. and the rest of the eu would be immediately damaging to the profitability and in some cases viability of exports of our products between those regions and, over the long term, might result in the need to relocate major manufacturing assets from one region to the other.​while we are not experiencing any material immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition. all of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the eu.our business is dependent on our intellectual property. if our intellectual property rights cannot be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.​proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the u.s., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then our ability to compete may be adversely affected. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. while it is our policy to enter into agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how. in addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or infringement in countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as u.s. law.the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or the failure of adequate legal remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, political events and general instability, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business.​conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and political events have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in international commerce and the global economy. the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers. accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our 29
table of contentssuppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. furthermore, instability and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases.changes in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, could adversely affect our business. for example, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make payment on our debts.​our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international. our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary.regulatory or market changes with respect to mtbe may materially reduce our sales and/or materially increase our costs.our joint venture with sinopec produces mtbe, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. because of the allegations that mtbe has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the u.s. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the u.s. market. our joint venture currently markets mtbe, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the u.s. this business has been profitable to us over time, and legislative or regulatory initiatives or changing consumer opinion outside the u.s. restricting mtbe or changing consumer opinion could materially adversely affect our ability to market and sell mtbe and our profitability. in 2017, china announced that it would implement a mandate to use gasoline containing 10% ethanol by 2020. we expect mtbe prices in china to continue facing downward pressure as a result of downstream refiners and blenders reduce operations in line with strong government initiative to improve environment in the country. our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and under certain circumstances we may have to significantly increase the level of cash funding to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business.​we have unfunded and underfunded obligations under some of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations. unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for our business. in addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years.with respect to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, the pension benefit guaranty corporation (“pbgc”) has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified pension plan under limited circumstances in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended. in the event our tax-qualified pension plans are terminated by the pbgc, we could be liable to the pbgc for the entire amount of the underfunding and, under certain circumstances, the liability could be senior to our notes. with respect to our foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans, the effects of underfunding depend on the country in which the pension and postretirement benefit plan is established. for example, in the u.k. and germany semi-public pension protection programs have the authority in certain circumstances to assume responsibility for underfunded pension schemes, including the right to recover the amount of the underfunding from us.30
table of contentsour debt level, a portion of which is subject to variable interest rates, makes us vulnerable to downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to obtain additional financing or to refinance our debt.​as of december 31, 2019, our total consolidated outstanding debt was $2,389 million (including current portion of debt); our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 44%; our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately $328 million; and our current portion of debt totaled $212 million. our debt level and the fact that a portion of our cash flow is required to make payments on our debt could have important consequences for our business, including but not limited to the following:●we may be more vulnerable to business, industry or economic downturns, making it more difficult to respond to market conditions;●cash flow available for other purposes, including the growth of our business, may be reduced;●our ability to refinance or obtain additional financing may be constrained, particularly during periods when the capital markets are unsettled;●our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us; and●part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates (for example, a 1% increase in interest rates, without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items, would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $3 million).​our debt level also impacts our credit ratings. any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could result in increased interest and other costs.risks related to our common stock and debt securitiescertain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value.certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as certain provisions of delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company, even if some of our stockholders were to consider such a change of control to be beneficial. our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. therefore, our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value.we have purchased, and may continue to purchase, a portion of our equity and debt securities, which could impact the market for our equity and debt securities and likely would negatively affect our liquidity.consistent with past practices, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our equity and debt securities in open market purchases, accelerated repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full calls for redemption or otherwise. any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. such transactions could negatively affect our liquidity.item 1b.  unresolved staff commentsas of the date of this filing, we did not have any unresolved comments from the staff of the sec.item 2.  properties we own or lease chemical manufacturing and research facilities in the locations indicated in the list below, which we believe are adequate for our short-term and anticipated long-term needs. we own or lease office space and storage facilities throughout the u.s. and in many foreign countries. our principal executive offices are located at 10003 31

table of contents​(4)during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded $153 million of tax benefit relating to the outside basis difference in our investment in venator, we recorded $18 million of tax benefit relating to realized tax losses on our remaining interest in venator, we established $11 million of significant income tax valuation allowance in australia and we recorded $32 million of deferred tax expense due to the reduction of tax rates in switzerland. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we released $119 million of significant income tax valuation allowances in switzerland, the u.k. and luxembourg. we eliminated the effect of these significant changes in tax valuation allowances and deferred tax assets and liabilities from our presentation of adjusted net income to allow investors to better compare our ongoing financial performance from period to period.​(5)in addition to income tax impacts, this adjusting item is also impacted by depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense.​non-gaap financial measuresour consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which we supplement with certain non-gaap financial information. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and the reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. these non-gaap measures exclude the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating results.adjusted ebitdaour management uses adjusted ebitda to assess financial performance. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments; (b) merger costs; (c) ebitda from discontinued operations; (d) noncontrolling interest of discontinued operations; (e) fair value adjustments to venator investment; (f) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (g) certain legal settlements and related expenses (income); (h) gain on sale of businesses/assets; (i) certain nonrecurring information technology project implementation costs; (j) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (k) plant incident remediation costs; (l) u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (“u.s. tax reform act”) impact on noncontrolling interest; and (m) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition (credits) costs. we believe that net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda.we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the businesses’ ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses’ operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. however, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. moreover, adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. for example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. in addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. as a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.nevertheless, our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance. for example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. 44
table of contentsour management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted ebitda by using this measure to supplement u.s. gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than u.s. gaap results alone.​adjusted net incomeadjusted net income is computed by eliminating the after tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to huntsman corporation: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments; (b) merger costs; (c) loss (income) from discontinued operations; (d) noncontrolling interest of discontinued operations; (e) fair value adjustments to venator investment; (f) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (g) certain legal settlements and related (income) expenses; (h) gain on sale of businesses/assets; (i) certain nonrecurring information technology project implementation costs; (j) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (k) significant activities related to deferred tax assets and liabilities; (l) u.s. tax reform act impact on income tax expense; (m) u.s. tax reform act impact on noncontrolling interest; (n) plant incident remediation costs; and (o) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition (credits) costs. basic adjusted net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. adjusted diluted net income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information.free cash flowmanagement internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate our liquidity, (b) evaluate strategic investments, (c) plan stock buyback and dividend levels, and (d) evaluate our ability to incur and service debt. free cash flow is not a defined term under u.s. gaap, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. the company defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations and used in investing activities from continuing operations, including non-recurring merger costs. free cash flow as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.adjusted effective tax ratewe believe that the effective tax rate of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted effective tax rate. we believe our adjusted effective tax rate provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses’ operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. we do not provide reconciliations for adjusted effective tax rate on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of certain items, such as business acquisition and integration expenses, merger costs, certain legal and other settlements and related costs, gains on sale of business/assets, and amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses. each of such adjustments has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. for the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. ​year ended december 31, 2019 compared with year ended december 31, 2018as discussed in “note 4. discontinued operations and business dispositions—sale of chemical intermediates businesses” and “note 4. discontinued operations and business dispositions—separation and deconsolidation of venator” to our consolidated financial statements, the results from continuing operations for all periods presented exclude the results of our chemical intermediates businesses and the results of our former polymers, base chemicals and australian styrenics businesses for all periods presented as well as the results of venator for 2018. the increase of $225 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the increase of $228 million in net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:​●revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by $807 million, or 11%, as compared with the 2018 period. the decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices in all our segments, except for 45
table of contentsour textile effects segment, and lower sales volumes in all our segments, except for our polyurethanes segment. see “—segment analysis” below.​●our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by $382 million and $385 million, respectively, or 22% each, as compared with the 2018 period. the decrease resulted from lower gross margins in all our segments. see “—segment analysis” below.​●our operating expenses and the operating expenses of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $12 million each, or 1% each, as compared with the 2018 period, primarily related to an increase in divestiture related costs, partially offset by the impact of translating foreign currency amounts to the u.s. dollar.​●restructuring, impairment and plant closing (credits) costs for the year ended december 31, 2019 was a credit of $41 million compared to a credit of $7 million in the 2018 period. for more information on restructuring activities, see “note 13. restructuring, impairment and plant closing (credits) costs” to our consolidated financial statements.​●we recorded a loss of $18 million in fair value adjustments to our investment in venator for the year ended december 2019 compared to a loss of $62 million in 2018. see “note 4. discontinued operations and business dispositions—separation and deconsolidation of venator” to our consolidated financial statements.​●loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased to $23 million from $3 million in the 2018 period in relation to the early repayment in full of our 2020 senior notes in the first quarter of 2019. see “note. 15. debt—notes” to our consolidated financial statements.​●our other income, net and the other income, net of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as compared with the 2018 period, primarily attributable to higher pension-related credits in the 2018 period. ​●our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased to $38 million from an expense of $45 million in the 2018 period. the income tax benefit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased to $41 million from an expense of $41 million in the 2018 period. the increase in tax benefit was primarily due to the decrease in pretax income along with discrete items in each period. in 2019, discrete items include tax benefits related to built-in capital losses and realized tax losses both on our remaining interest in venator, partially offset by tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance in australia and the change in tax rate in switzerland. in 2018, discrete items include tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances in switzerland, luxembourg and the u.k., partially offset by additional provisional deemed repatriation transition tax. our income tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions]. for further information concerning income taxes, see “note 20. income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements.​46

table of contentscontractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations. we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased. we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we made minimum payments of $1 million, nil and nil, respectively, under such take or pay contracts without taking the product.​(3)totals do not include commitments pertaining to our pension and other postretirement obligations. our estimated future contributions to our pension and postretirement plans related to continuing operations are as follows (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​    ​​    ​​    ​​    5-year​​​​​​​​​​​average​    2020    2021 - 2022    2023 - 2024    annualpension plans​$ 83​$ 148​$ 121​$ 61other postretirement obligations​  5​  11​  10​  5​(4)the above table does not reflect expected tax payments and unrecognized tax benefits due to the inability to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing and amount of payments. totals also do not include installment obligations for the u.s. tax reform act deemed repatriation transition tax of approximately $44 million, to be paid $5 million in 2023 and $39 million after 2023. for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits, see “note 20. income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements.​off-balance sheet arrangementsno off-balance sheet arrangements exist.restructuring, impairment and plant closing costsfor a discussion of restructuring plans and the costs involved, see “note 13. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs” to our consolidated financial statements.recently issued accounting pronouncementsfor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see “note 2. summary of significant accounting policies—recently issued accounting pronouncements” to our consolidated financial statements.​critical accounting policiesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. our significant accounting policies are summarized in “note 2. summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements. summarized below are our critical accounting policies:income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2019, we had total valuation allowances of $231 million. see “note 20. income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our valuation allowances.57
table of contentsemployee benefit programswe sponsor several contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans, covering employees primarily in the u.s., the u.k., the netherlands, belgium and switzerland, but also covering employees in a number of other countries. we fund the material plans through trust arrangements (or local equivalents) where the assets are held separately from us. we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the u.s. and canada. amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries. inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, compensation increases, mortality rates and health care cost trends. these assumptions are described in “note 19. employee benefit plans” to our consolidated financial statements.management, with the advice of actuaries, uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based. the effect of a 1% change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):​​​​​​​​    statement of    balance sheetassumptions    operations(1)    impact(2)discount rate ​   ​  —1% increase​$ (36)​$ (482)—1% decrease​  43​  562expected long-term rates of return on plan assets​   ​   —1% increase​  (26)​  ——1% decrease​  26​  —rate of compensation increase​   ​   —1% increase​  11​ 49—1% decrease​  (11)​ (56)(1)estimated increase (decrease) on 2019 net periodic benefit cost​(2)estimated increase (decrease) on december 31, 2019 pension and postretirement liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss​contingent loss accrualswe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. we have an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. these policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. for further information, see “note 21. commitments and contingencies—legal matters” to our consolidated financial statements.goodwillwe test our goodwill for impairment at least annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. approximately 64% and 30% of our goodwill balance relates to our mdi urethanes reporting unit and our advanced materials reporting unit, respectively. the remaining goodwill relates to two other reporting units.fair value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. the estimated fair values of our reporting units are dependent on several significant assumptions including, among others, market information, discount rates, operating results, earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows.we tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed. our most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amounts of all reporting units by a significant margin.58

table of contentsallowances are evaluated on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, the company considers the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits the company’s ability to consider other subjective evidence such as taxable income for the future. the company’s valuation allowances as of december 31, 2019, were $231 million.we identified management’s determination that it is not more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize some of its deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments and estimates management makes related to future taxable income. this required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future taxable income.how the critical audit matter was addressed in the auditour audit procedures related to estimated future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized included the following, among others:●we tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation allowance for income taxes, including management’s controls over the estimates of future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.●with the assistance of our income tax specialists, we considered the following sources of management’s estimated future taxable income:–estimates of future taxable income–future reversals of existing temporary differences–taxable income in historical periods (when carryback was permitted)●we tested the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future taxable income by comparing the estimates to:–historical taxable income–internal communications to management and the board of directors–forecasted information included in company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the company and certain of its peer companies●we evaluated whether the taxable income in prior carryback years was of the appropriate character and available under the tax law.●we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods, assumptions, and judgments used by management to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary.​​/s/ deloitte & touche llp​houston, texasfebruary 13, 2020we have served as the company’s auditor since 1984.​​​​f-3

table of contentshuntsman corporation and subsidiarieshuntsman international llc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements (continued)items are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain international operations are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent effective. the effectiveness of a cash flow hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge, and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three months. a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is determined to be effective if the change in value of the hedge divided by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of 80% to 125%. hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction. for a derivative that does not qualify or has not been designated as a hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.​environmental expendituresenvironmental related restoration and remediation costs are recorded as liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation and clean-up obligations are either known or considered probable and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. other environmental expenditures that are principally maintenance or preventative in nature are recorded when expended and incurred and are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. see “note 22. environmental, health and safety matters.”​equity method investments we account for our equity investments where we own a non-controlling interest, but exercise significant influence, under the equity method of accounting. under the equity method of accounting, our original cost of the investment is adjusted for our share of equity in the earnings of the equity investee and reduced by dividends and distributions of capital received, unless the fair value option is elected, in which case the investment balance is marked to fair value each reporting period and the impact of changes in fair value of the equity investment are reported in earnings. we elected the fair value option to account for our equity method investment in venator. for more information, see “note 4. discontinued operations and business dispositions—separation and deconsolidation of venator.” the change in the fair value related to our equity method investment in venator is presented in “fair value adjustments to venator investment” on the consolidated statements of operations.​foreign currency translationthe accounts of our operating subsidiaries outside of the u.s., unless they are operating in highly inflationary economic environments, consider the functional currency to be the currency of the economic environment in which they operate. accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at a weighted average rate for the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded to equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.if a subsidiary operates in an economic environment that is considered to be highly inflationary (100% cumulative inflation over a three-year period), the u.s. dollar is considered to be the functional currency and gains and losses from remeasurement to the u.s. dollar from the local currency are included in the statement of operations. where a subsidiary’s operations are effectively run, managed, financed and contracted in u.s. dollars, such as certain finance subsidiaries outside of the u.s., the u.s. dollar is considered to be the functional currency.foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other operating expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of operations and were (losses) gains of $(8) million, $3 million and $5 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting f-19
table of contentshuntsman corporation and subsidiarieshuntsman international llc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements (continued)purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. tax reform act was signed into law. the u.s. tax reform act significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, (effective january 1, 2018), creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax provision (“beat”) and a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“gilti”) (effective january 1, 2018) and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the enactment of the u.s. tax reform act, the company recorded a net tax benefit of $20 million over 2017 and 2018. we recorded a net tax benefit of $135 million due to a remeasurement of deferred u.s. tax assets and liabilities (including a provisional tax benefit of $137 million in 2017, partially offset by a final tax expense of $2 million in 2018) offset by tax expense of $115 million due to the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income (including a provisional tax expense of $85 million in 2017 and a $30 million measurement period adjustment in 2018). we did not make the election to reclassify the income tax effects of the u.s. tax reform act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.​accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements. for further information concerning taxes, see “note 20. income taxes.”​intangible assets and goodwillintangible assets are stated at cost (fair value at the time of acquisition) and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the life of the related agreement as follows:​patents and technology5 - 30 yearstrademarks9 - 30 yearslicenses and other agreements5 - 15 yearsother intangibles5 - 15 years​goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not subject to any method of amortization, but is tested for impairment annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related reporting unit, we are required to reduce the amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings. fair value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. ​f-20
table of contentshuntsman corporation and subsidiarieshuntsman international llc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements (continued)during 2019, goodwill decreased by approximately $2 million due to the finalization of the valuation of the assets and liabilities of an acquisition, partially offset by a net increase of approximately $1 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. see “note 3. business combinations and acquisitions.”​inventories​inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using lifo, first-in first-out, and average costs methods for different components of inventory.legal costswe expense legal costs, including those legal costs incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.net income per share attributable to huntsman corporationbasic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to huntsman corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. diluted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing net income available to huntsman corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities.basic and diluted income per share is determined using the following information (in millions):​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​year ended december 31, ​    2019    2018    2017numerator:​​​​​​​​​basic and diluted income from continuing operations:​​​​​​​​​income from continuing operations attributable to huntsman corporation ​$ 393​$ 608​$ 406basic and diluted net income:​​​​​​​​​net income attributable to huntsman corporation     $ 562​$ 337​$ 636denominator:​​​​​​​​​weighted average shares outstanding ​​ 228.9​​ 238.1​​ 238.4dilutive shares:​​​​​​​​​stock-based awards ​​ 1.7​​ 3.5​​ 5.5total weighted average shares outstanding, including dilutive shares​​ 230.6​​ 241.6​​ 243.9​additional stock-based awards of 3.0 million, 0.8 million and 0.8 million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. however, these stock-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the respective periods mentioned because the effect would be anti-dilutive.other noncurrent assetsperiodic maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities (a “turnaround”) are accounted for on the deferral basis by capitalizing the costs of the turnaround and amortizing the costs over the estimated period until the next turnaround.principles of consolidationour consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.f-21

table of contentshuntsman corporation and subsidiarieshuntsman international llc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements (continued)among entities by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. the amendments in this asu require lessees to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. in january 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-01, leases (topic 842): land easement practical expedient for transition to topic 842, providing an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current leases guidance in topic 840, and in july 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-11, leases (topic 842): targeted improvements, providing an optional transition method allowing entities to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. the amendments in these asus are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2018. reporting entities can elect to recognize and measure leases under these amendments at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach or otherwise elect the transition method provided under asu no. 2018-11. on january 1, 2019, we adopted the amendments in these asus using the transition method that allowed us to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date. the initial adoption of the new lease standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, but did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of operations. the most significant impact was the recognition of operating lease liabilities and operating lease right-of-use assets. on january 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $400 million and operating lease right-of-use assets of $371 million. as a result of the adoption of these amendments, we revised our accounting policy for leases as detailed in “note 9. leases.”​in august 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-12, derivatives and hedging (topic 815): targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities. the amendments in this asu better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships as well as the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements to increase the understandability of the results of an entity’s intended hedging strategies. the amendments in this asu also include certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. transition requirements and elections should be applied to hedging relationships existing on the date of adoption. for cash flow and net investment hedges, an entity should apply a cumulative-effect adjustment related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness, and the amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective january 1, 2019, and the initial adoption of this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. ​in august 2018, the sec issued a final rule, sec final rule release no. 33-10532, disclosure update and simplification, that amends certain of its disclosure requirements that have become redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded, in light of other sec disclosure requirements or u.s. gaap. for filings on form 10-q, the final rule, amongst other items, extends to interim periods the annual requirement to disclose changes in stockholders’ equity. as amended by the final rule, registrants must now analyze changes in stockholders’ equity, in the form of a reconciliation, for the then current and comparative year-to-date interim periods, with subtotals for each interim period. the final rule became effective on november 5, 2018, that date being 30 days after its publication in the federal register. we applied these changes in the presentation of stockholders’ equity beginning in the first quarter of 2019.​accounting pronouncements pending adoption in future periods ​in august 2018, the fasb issued asu no. 2018-14, compensation—retirement benefits—defined benefit plans—general (topic 820):

table of contentshuntsman corporation and subsidiarieshuntsman international llc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements (continued)interest rate riskthrough our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio, including the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest-bearing liabilities, as well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments.from time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate exposures. under interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. on january 9, 2019, we entered into a six-year $17 million notional value interest rate hedge with a fixed rate of 2.66%. this swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swap was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. in november 2019, we terminated this swap and paid $1 million to our counterparties. this $1 million settlement will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings.​during 2019, there were no other reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates.​foreign exchange rate riskour cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies. we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $135 million and $151 million, respectively, notional amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month.in november 2014, we entered into two five-year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight-year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional $200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. in august 2017, we terminated these cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $7 million from the counterparties.a portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than the entities’ functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges.foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans.we review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2019, we have designated approximately €435 million (approximately $485 million) of euro-denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the amounts recognized on the hedge of our net investment were a gain of $14 million, a gain of $35 million and a loss of $96 million, respectively, and were recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income.f-41

table of contentshuntsman corporation and subsidiarieshuntsman international llc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements (continued)the sales contract is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. in order to estimate the applicable variable consideration, we use historical and current trend information to estimate the amount of discounts or rebates to which customers are likely to be entitled. historically, actual discount or rebate adjustments relative to those estimated and included when determining the transaction price have not materially differed. payment terms vary but are generally less than one year. as our standard payment terms are less than one year, we have elected to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. in the normal course of business, we do not accept product returns unless the item is defective as manufactured. we establish provisions for estimated returns based on an analysis of historical experience. ​19.  employee benefit plans defined benefit and other postretirement benefitwe provide a trusteed, non contributory defined benefit pension plan (the “plan”) that covers the majority of our u.s. employees. effective july 1, 2004, the plan formula for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement was converted to a cash balance design. for represented employees, participation in the cash balance design was subject to the terms of negotiated contracts. for participating employees, benefits accrued under the prior formula were converted to opening cash balance accounts. the cash balance benefit formula provides annual pay credits from 6% to 12% of eligible pay, depending on age and service, plus accrued interest. the conversion to the cash balance plan did not have a significant impact on the accrued benefit liability, the funded status or ongoing pension expense.beginning july 1, 2014, the huntsman defined benefit pension plan was closed to new non-union entrants and as of april 1, 2015, it was closed to new union entrants. in addition, as of january 1, 2015, rubicon llc closed its defined benefit plan to new entrants. following the closure of these plans, new hires have been provided with a defined contribution plan with a non-discretionary employer contribution of 6% of pay and a company match of up to 4% of pay, for a total company contribution of up to 10% of pay. we also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, which provide medical and life insurance benefits. effective august 1, 2015, the post retirement benefit plans were closed to new entrants.our postretirement benefit plans provide access to two fully insured medicare part d plans including prescription drug benefits affected by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (the “act”). we cannot determine whether the medical benefits provided by our postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to those provided by the act. we do not collect a subsidy and our net periodic postretirement benefits cost, and related benefit obligation, do not reflect an amount associated with the subsidy. we do not subsidize the premium cost of these plans; the premiums are entirely paid by the retirees.we sponsor defined benefit plans in a number of countries outside of the u.s. the availability of these plans, and their specific design provisions, are consistent with local competitive practices and regulations.f-45
