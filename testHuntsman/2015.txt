item 1.    business        







general  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our company, a delaware
corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the businesses of huntsman holdings, llc, a company founded by jon m. huntsman. mr. huntsman founded the predecessor to our company in 1970 as a
small polystyrene plastics packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of significant acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 

we
operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999. 


our
principal executive offices are located at 10003 woodloch forest drive, the woodlands, texas 77380, and our telephone number at that location is (281) 719-6000. 







overview  

we operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our
products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of
applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging,
paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines,
surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. our administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations
are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below, which are located in 30 countries. as of december 31, 2015, we employed approximately 15,000
associates worldwide. our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $10,299 million, $11,578 million and $11,079 million, respectively. 







our products  

we produce differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and
textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces primarily inorganic chemical products. 


growth
in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. accordingly, the
profitability of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the

statements and "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this form 10-k. 







polyurethanes  







general  

we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including mdi products, po, polyols, pg
and tpu (each discussed in more detail below under "—products and markets"). polyurethane chemicals are used to
produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. we focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. growth in
our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. we operate five primary polyurethane
manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. we also operate 19 strategically located polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as "systems houses,"
located in close proximity to our customers worldwide (see facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below), which enables us to focus on customer support and technical service. we
also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing 

3




 

table of contents

facility
focused on the insulation market and three tpu manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. 


our
customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as mdi, with polyols, which are derived largely from po and eo. we are able to produce over
2,000 distinct mdi-based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations.
as a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from mdi, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and
appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, adhesives, wood binders, footwear and other specialized engineering applications. 


we
are one of three north american producers of po. we and some of our customers process po into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, pg and various other
chemical products. end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings
and cleaning products industries. we also produce mtbe as a co-product of our po manufacturing process. mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to
enhance the octane rating of gasoline. see "—item 1a. risk factors." 


in
1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china. we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated
polyurethanes formulation facility. in january 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai, china in caojing. in june 2006, hps, a
consolidated joint venture, began production at our mdi finishing plant. in september 2006, slic, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at the mnb, aniline and crude mdi plants. we intend
to expand the capacity of these facilities by 2018. these world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the long-term demand
growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. additionally, in november 2012, we entered into an agreement with sinopec to form a joint venture to build a world scale po/mtbe
plant in nanjing, china. the
facility is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, with start-up expected in the first half of 2017, and will utilize our proprietary po/mtbe manufacturing technology. we own a 49%
interest in the joint venture. 







products and markets  

mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam as well as coatings,
adhesives, sealants and elastomers. polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with mdi in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. po is one of the
principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols. the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals.

polyurethane
chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. depending on their needs, customers will use either commodity polyurethane
chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. by varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are
able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products. 

mdi.    mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other
polyurethane materials. this is primarily because mdi can be
used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. we believe that future growth of mdi will be driven by the continued
substitution of mdi-based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction. we expect that other markets, such as binders for reconstituted wood
board products, specialty cushioning applications and coatings will
further contribute to the continued growth of mdi. with the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies, asian markets have now become the largest in the world for mdi. 

mdi
experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. sales generally peak
during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 

tpu.    tpu is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of
mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce
unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific
requirements of our customers. tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. it is also extruded into films, wires and cables for use in a wide
variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets. 

polyols.    polyols are combined with mdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of
polyurethane products. demand for specialty polyols has
been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown. 

5




 

table of contents

aniline.    aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi. generally,
aniline is either consumed internally or is sold to third
parties under long-term supply contracts. we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with
an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract. 

po.    po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg.
demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand,
especially that of consumer durables. the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po. 



  


mtbe.    mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions
and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline. while
mtbe has been effectively eliminated in the united states, demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. see "—item 1a. risk factors." in 2011, we announced the signing of
a license agreement with chinese chemicals manufacturer yantai wanhua polyurethanes co., ltd, for the production of po and mtbe. in november 2012, we entered into an agreement to
form a joint venture with sinopec to construct and operate a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51%
interest. see "—manufacturing and operations" below and "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." 







sales and marketing  

our global sales group markets our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,500 customers in approximately 100 countries. our sales and
technical resources are organized to support major regional markets and key end-use markets, which requires a global approach. these key end-use markets include the appliance, automotive, footwear,
furniture and coatings, construction products, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries.

table of contents 

we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we
provide the
total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers in ready-to-use form. our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers' needs is
critical to our long-term success. we have strategically located our polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. we believe this
customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers. we manufacture polyols
primarily to support our mdi customers' requirements. 

we
believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have
facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing
innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service. 







manufacturing and operations  

our mdi production facilities are located in geismar, louisiana; rotterdam, the netherlands; and through our joint ventures in
caojing, china. these facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of mdi, from our facilities located in geismar, louisiana; wilton, u.k.; and caojing, china. we
believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers. in addition to reducing transportation costs for our
raw materials, integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices.

our approximately 85% share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation. 
 


at
our geismar, rotterdam and caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce mdi. this technology contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer.
in addition to mdi, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po. we own or license all technology and know-how developed and utilized at our po facility. our process combines

isobutane
and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming tbhp and tba, which are further processed into po and mtbe, respectively. because our po production process is
less expensive relative to other technologies and allows po co-products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct
advantages over its alternatives. 







joint ventures  

rubicon joint venture.    chemtura corporation is our joint venture partner in rubicon llc,
which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa
manufacturing facilities in geismar, louisiana. we are entitled to approximately 85% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc, and chemtura corporation is entitled to
100% of the dpa production. in addition to operating the joint venture's aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa facilities, rubicon llc operates our wholly-owned mdi, polyol and maleic anhydride
facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex. as a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs
for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements. 

chinese mdi joint ventures.    we are involved in two related joint ventures which operate mdi
production facilities in caojing, china. slic, our
manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies, produces mnb, aniline and crude mdi. we effectively own 35% of slic and account for our investment under the equity method.
hps, our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd, manufactures pure mdi, polymeric mdi and mdi variants. we own 70% of hps and it is consolidated in our
financial statements. these projects have
been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. the total production capacity of the slic facilities is 660 million pounds per year of mdi and
the splitting capacity of the hps facility is 350 million pounds per year of mdi. 

chinese po/mtbe joint venture.    in november 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a
joint venture with sinopec. the joint venture
involves the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51% interest. our total
equity investment is anticipated to be approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. at the end of 2015, cumulative capital contributions were approximately
$85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. construction of the project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, with start-up expected in the first half of 2017. 







raw materials  

the primary raw materials for mdi-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po. benzene is a widely available commodity that is the
primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline. historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture
nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce mdi. 

a
major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po. the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a
competitively priced, strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products. the primary raw materials used in our po production process are
butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen. we purchase a large portion of our raw materials under long-term contracts.

competition  

our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include basf, covestro, dow, yantai wanhua and lyondellbasell. while these
competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic
ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical
and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance, our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and providing customers with innovative solutions
to their needs. 

some
of our competitors in the polyurethanes segment are among the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies. these competitors may have their own raw
material resources. some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. in addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them
to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. if any of our current or future competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them
to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. see "—item 1a. risk factors."

amines.    amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by
reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene
derivatives. generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, detergent, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. growth in demand for amines is highly correlated
with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets. however, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have grown at rates well in excess
of gdp growth due to new product development, technical innovation, and substitution and replacement of competing products. for example, polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly
sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling
customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials. ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia. they are used in the production
of a variety of industrial, agricultural and consumer products. there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. as amines are generally sold based upon the
performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use application, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. 


morpholine/dga® agent.    morpholine and dga® agent are produced as co-products by
reacting ammonia with deg. morpholine is
used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing (as an accelerator) and flocculants for water treatment. dga® agent is primarily used in gas treating,
electronics, herbicides and metalworking end-use applications. 

carbonates.    ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with
carbon dioxide. carbonates are used as solvents and as
reactive diluents in polymer and coating 

11




 

table of contents

applications.
they are also increasingly being used as a photo-resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards, solar panels, lcd screens and the production of lithium batteries. 

maleic anhydride and licensing.    maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced
by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through
the use of a catalyst. the largest use of maleic anhydride in the u.s. is in the production of uprs, which we believe account for approximately 48% of north american maleic anhydride demand. total
north american demand for maleic anhydride in 2015 was approximately 688 million pounds. total european demand for maleic anhydride in 2015 was approximately 536 million pounds.
generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs. upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins,
which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. 

our
maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy-efficient, high-percentage solvent
recovery system. this process competes against two other processes, the fluid bed process and the fixed bed
process with water recovery. we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. the maleic anhydride-based route to bdo manufacture is
currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which include po, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. as a result, the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in
increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. 


intermediates.    the following table sets forth the end-market applications for our
intermediate products:

solvents



 
surfactants.    surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water
soluble component with a water insoluble component in the
same molecule. while surfactants are most
commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries. 

12




 

table of contents

demand
growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved
performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and
properties. for basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. 

lab.    lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with
either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins. nearly
all the lab produced globally is converted into las, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. 

three
major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america: procter & gamble, henkel and the sun products corporation. we believe that over half of
the lab global capacity lies in the hands of seven producers, with two to three major producers in each of the three regional markets. growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is
expected to be higher than gdp. we have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market. with a significant technical barrier to entry, our specialty
alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus lab-only producers. 

eg.    we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg: meg, deg and teg.
meg is consumed primarily in the polyester (fiber and
bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. deg is consumed
internally for the production of morpholine and dga® agent and polyols. teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. we
continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg. 







sales and marketing  

we sell over 2,000 products to over 4,000 customers globally through our performance products sales groups, which have extensive
market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships. 

in
our specialty markets (energy and resources, polymers and resins, and functional chemicals), our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain
customer applications. we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers. 

our
intermediates are sold mainly into the global home and personal care market. we also sell eg. 


we
also provide extensive pre-and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development
functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. finally, these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business
leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. in addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that
also sell our products. these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end-use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces.

feedstocks, at our port neches, texas facility. all of the ethylene is used to produce eo and all of the propylene is used to produce po at our port neches, texas facility (primarily for our
polyurethanes segment). we have the capacity to use approximately 900 million pounds of ethylene each year in the production of eo and ethyleneamines. accordingly, we purchase or toll the
remainder of our ethylene requirements from third parties. we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg, surfactants, carbonates and amines products. we also use internally produced po and
deg in the manufacture of these products. 

in
addition to internally produced raw materials, the main raw materials used in the production of our amines are ethylene dichloride, caustic soda, ammonia, hydrogen, methylamines and
acrylonitrile. the majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices. 


in
the production of surfactants and lab, our primary raw materials, in addition to internally produced and third-party sourced eo and ethylene, are synthetic and natural alcohols,
paraffin, alpha olefins, benzene and nonylphenol. all of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices. 

maleic
anhydride is produced by the reaction of n-butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst. the principal raw material is n-butane which is purchased pursuant to long-term
contracts and delivered to our pensacola, florida site by barge, to our facility in geismar, louisiana via pipeline and to our moers, germany site by railcar. our maleic anhydride catalyst is
toll-manufactured by a third party under a long-term contract according to our proprietary methods. these raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 







competition  

in our specialty markets, there are relatively few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of
product formulations, the proprietary nature of
many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved. some of our global competitors include basf, air products,
dow, tosoh and akzonobel. we compete primarily on the basis of product performance, new product innovation and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of price. in our maleic anhydride market, we compete
primarily on the basis of price, customer service, technical support and logistics management. our competitors include lanxess, flint hills resources, bartek, polynt and ashland. we are the leading
global producer of maleic anhydride catalyst. competitors in our maleic anhydride catalyst market include scientific design, ineos, basf and polynt. in our maleic anhydride technology licensing
market, our primary competitor is scientific design. we compete primarily on the basis of technological performance and service.

table of contents

there
are numerous global producers of many of our intermediate products. our main competitors include global companies such as dow/meglobal, sasol, basf, petresa, clariant, shell,
stepan, croda and kao, as well as various smaller or more local competitors. we compete on the basis of price with respect to the majority of our intermediate product offerings and, to a lesser
degree, on the basis of product availability, performance and service with respect to certain of our more value-added products. 


the
market in which our performance products segment operates is highly competitive. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated
petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. in addition, some of our competitors have greater
financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. if any of our current or future competitors develop
proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.

raw materials  

the principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol a, mda,
phenol and aminophenols. we also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and
additives. raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of the costs for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the terms of our supply contracts vary, but,
in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. formula pricing is sometimes used if advantageous for the business. 

additionally,
we produce large volumes of some of our most important raw materials, such as blr and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products.
approximately 65% of the blr we produce is consumed internally in our downstream products. the balance of our blr is sold in the merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our
production plants and lower our overall blr production cost. we believe that manufacturing a large proportion of our own blr gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based polymer systems
formulators, who buy blr from third-party suppliers. this position helps protect us from pricing pressure from blr suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of blr in difficult market
conditions.

textile effects  







general  

our textile effects segment is a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals, dyes and inks in our chosen markets. our
textile solutions enhance the color of finished textiles and improve such performance characteristics as wrinkle resistance and the ability to repel water and stains. our textile effects segment is
characterized by the breadth of our product offering, our long-standing relationships with our customers, our ability to develop and adapt our technology and our applications expertise for new markets
and new applications. 

19




 

table of contents


we
operate synthesis, formulating and production facilities in north america, europe, asia and south america. we market multiple products to customers in multiple end-markets, including
the following: consumer fashion apparel, sportswear, career and uniform apparel, military, automotive, home textiles and furnishings, carpet and other functional textiles. 

during
2011, our textile effects segment began implementing a significant restructuring program, including the closure of our production facilities and business support offices in
basel, switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the segment's long-term global competitiveness and designed to reduce annualized costs by approximately
$75 million. in connection with this program, during 2015, our textile effects segment recorded charges of $9 million for non-cancelable long-term contract termination costs,
$21 million for decommissioning and $1 million of
other restructuring costs associated with this initiative. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we settled certain of our obligations under these long-term contracts and recorded a restructuring charge
of $14 million. in addition, we recorded charges of $6 million associated with other initiatives. 







products and markets  

textiles generally involve a complex matrix of fibers, effects and functionality, and the resulting products range from fashion
apparel to bulletproof vests, home linens to carpet, and upholstery to automotive interiors. our broad range of dyestuffs, chemicals and inks enhance both the aesthetic appearance of these products
and the functionality needed to ensure that they perform in their end-use markets. since the requirements for these markets vary dramatically, our business strategy focuses on the three major
markets—apparel, home and institutional and technical textiles. we work to provide the right balance of products and service to meet the technical challenges in each of these markets. our
textile effects segment is affected by seasonal holiday closures and typically experiences lower sales in those periods. for example, we typically experience lower sales in asia in the first quarter
as a result of the lunar new year, in europe as a result of the summer holidays, and in the americas and europe during the christmas season at year-end. 


the
apparel market focuses on products that provide an aesthetic effect and/or improve the processing efficiency within the textile mill. we offer a complete range of colors for cotton,
polyester and nylon that cover the range of shades needed for sportswear, intimate apparel, towels, sheeting and casual wear. our dyes have been developed to ensure that they offer the highest levels
of wash fastness currently available in the market. optical brighteners and other pretreatment products provide "bright white" effects for apparel, towels and sheeting. pretreatment and dyeing
auxiliaries ensure that these fabrics are processed efficiently and effectively—cleaning the fabrics with fewer chemicals, less energy and less water and thereby minimizing the
environmental footprint and reducing the processing costs. silicone softeners may be used to enhance the feel of products. 

technical
textiles include automotive textiles, carpet, military fabrics, mattress ticking and nonwoven and other technical fabrics. though the product groups may differ in their end
uses, the articles must provide a high-level of functionality and performance in their respective markets. high-lightfast dyes and uv absorbers are used in automotive interiors and outdoor furnishings
to provide colors that do not fade when exposed to sunlight and heat. powerful stain repellent and release technology imparts durable protection for upholstery, military and medical fabrics, without
affecting the color, breathability or feel of the fabric. specialized dyes and prints create unique camouflage patterns for military uniforms, backpacks and tarps that will not fade through wash and
wear or during exposure to the elements.

sales and marketing  

for our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. effect
competence—delivering value-added effects to our customers' products—enables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts to
differentiate themselves from competitors. process competence—applying know-how and expertise to improve customers' processes—allows us to utilize our technical service to
reduce cost, enhance efficiency and offer recommendations to improve the ecological and environmental footprint in the wet processing of textiles. 







manufacturing and operations  

we are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: eame, the americas and asia. to service our
customers efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of service and minimize the cost to
our customers. the following table summarizes the plants that we operate:

raw materials  

the manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials (approximately 1,000 different chemicals),
including amines, fluorochemicals and sulfones. no one raw material represents greater than 5% of our textile effects raw material expenditures. raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of
sales for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the
quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. 







competition  

we are a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals and dyes in our chosen markets. competition within the textile
chemicals and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who offer complete solutions for both markets. our major competitors are archroma (businesses formerly owned by clariant and
basf), kiri-dystar and longsheng. we believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering, which is characterized by its broad range; high quality; significant integration between
products and service; reliable technical expertise; long-standing relationships with customers; and strong business infrastructure in asia. we believe that we have more customer service capability and
account management capability than any of our competitors worldwide. 







pigments and additives  







general  

we are a diversified global supplier of pigments and additives. our pigments and additives improve performance and add color to
thousands of everyday items including paints, inks, plastics, concrete, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food. we offer a wide range of products across the color spectrum. our broad product range,
coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. 


we
operate 31 manufacturing facilities. our ten titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities are predominately located in europe and our 16 color pigments manufacturing and processing
facilities are mainly located in europe and the united states. we also operate five facilities producing water treatment, timber treatment chemicals and functional additives. 

on
october 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses ("the rockwood acquisition") of rockwood holdings, inc.
("rockwood"). we paid $1.02 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded pension liabilities in connection with the rockwood
acquisition. for more information, see "note 3. business combinations" to our consolidated financial statements. 

in
connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the rockwood acquisition, we sold our tio2 tr52 product line used in printing inks to henan billions
chemicals co., ltd. ("henan") in december 2014. the sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply tr52 product to henan during a transitional
period. 

on
december 1, 2014, we announced that we are taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our pigments and additives segment. as part of a comprehensive
restructuring program, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 900 positions. annual cost savings are expected to be approximately $140 million and are expected to be achieved by the
middle of 2016. in connection with this restructuring program, during 2015 we recorded restructuring expense 

22




 

table of contents

of
$61 million for workforce reduction, $3 million for pension related charges and $15 million in other restructuring costs associated with this initiative. 

on
february 12, 2015, we announced a plan to close the 'black end' manufacturing operations and ancillary activities at our calais, france site, which reduced our titanium
dioxide capacity by approximately 100 kilotons, or 13% of our european titanium dioxide capacity. in connection with this announcement, we began to accelerate depreciation on the affected assets and
recorded accelerated depreciation in 2015 of $68 million as restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs. in addition, during 2015, we recorded charges of $30 million primarily for
workforce reductions and non-cash charges of $17 million. the 'black end' manufacturing operations and ancillary activities are now closed. the 'white end' of the site continues to operate. 

on
march 4, 2015, we announced plans to restructure our color pigments business, another step in our previously announced plan to significantly restructure our global pigments
and additives segment, and recorded restructuring expense of approximately $4 million during 2015 primarily related to workforce reductions. 

during
the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the south african asset group of our pigments and additives segment was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of
$19 million. 

we
remain committed to a separation of our titanium dioxide business and we are actively exploring additional possibilities outside of an initial public offering or a spin-off. our
ability to effect such separation is subject to, among other things, market conditions and the approval of our board of directors. see "—item 1a. risk factors." 







products and markets  


titanium dioxide.    we are a global leader in the manufacture and marketing of specialty and
standard grade titanium dioxide. titanium dioxide is
derived from titanium bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items including paints, plastics, paper, inks, fibers, food and
personal care products. 

we
own a portfolio of brands including the tioxide®, hombitan®, deltio®, and altiris® ranges, which are produced in our ten manufacturing
facilities around the globe. we service over 2,500 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global
customers, including ampacet, a. schulman, akzonobel, basf, clariant, jotun, polyone, ppg and sun chemical. 

global
titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track gdp growth rates; however, this varies by region. developed markets such as the u.s. and western europe exhibit higher
absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates. the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales
reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end-use markets. coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes
during the second and third quarters of the year. 

there
are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for
approximately 45% of global production capacity. most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing
route—for example, the inks market prefers sulfate and the automotive coatings market 

23




 

table of contents

prefers
chloride. regional markets typically favor products that are available locally. the sulfate process produces titanium dioxide in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in
certain high-value specialty applications. 

our
company is one of the five major producers of titanium dioxide in the world. beyond these producers, the titanium dioxide industry currently has a large number of small regional or
local producers, particularly in china. titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks,
efficiency improvements and, more recently, new capacity additions in china. during periods of low titanium dioxide demand, the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces
production to manage working capital. pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply/demand balance. 

we
have an established broad customer base and have successfully differentiated ourselves by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche market segments where the
innovation and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher margins, higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships.

iron
oxide pigment's cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete,
brick and roof tile, for coatings such as paints and plastics. we are one of two large color pigments producers which represent approximately 40% of the global market for iron oxide pigments. the
remaining market share consists primarily of chinese competitors. 


made
from clay, our ultramarine blue pigments are non-toxic, weather resistant and thermally stable. ultramarine blue is used world-wide for food contact applications. our synthetic
ultramarines are permitted for unrestricted use in certain cosmetics applications. ultramarine blue is used extensively in plastics and the paint industry. we focus on supplying our customers with
technical grade ultramarine blues and violets to high specification markets such as the cosmetics industry. 

we
are constructing a new advanced technology production facility in augusta, georgia for the synthesis of iron oxide pigments. we are the first iron oxide pigments producer to invest
in u.s. based capacity in more than 35 years. the new augusta facility will enable significant plant consolidation, cost savings opportunities and favorable raw material sourcing while
reinforcing our color pigments offering of quality pigment, service and shortened lead time on delivery. we expect the augusta facility to be complete in the first quarter of 2016.

timber treatment chemicals.    we manufacture timber treatment wood protection chemicals used
primarily in residential and commercial applications to
prolong the service life of wood through protection from decay and fungal or insect attack. 

we
manufacture our timber treatment chemicals in the u.s. and market our products primarily in north america through viance, llc ("viance"), our 50%-owned joint venture with dow
chemical formed in 2007. our residential construction products such as acq, ecolife™ and copper azole are sold for use in decking, fencing and other residential outdoor wood structures.
our industrial construction products such as chromated copper arsenate (cca) are sold for use in telephone poles and salt water piers and pilings. 


water treatment chemicals.    we manufacture water treatment chemicals in germany used to
improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal
applications. we are one of europe's largest suppliers of polyaluminium chloride (pac) based flocculants with approximately 140 kilotons of production capacity. main markets are municipal and
industrial waste water treatment and the paper industry. 







sales and marketing  

approximately 85% of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our global sales and technical services network, enabling us to work
closely with our customers. our focused sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our
products. 

we
sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through specialty distributors. we sell the majority of our timber treatment
products directly to end customers via viance. 

our
focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. for example, we believe that our pigments and additives segment is well-positioned to
benefit from growth sectors where customers' needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. we maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected
markets.

capacity shown reflects our 50% interest in louisiana pigment company, l.p.  
 
 





joint ventures  

louisiana pigment company, l.p. is our 50%-owned joint venture with kronos. we share production offtake and operating costs of
the plant with kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has
equal representation. our investment in louisiana pigment company, l.p. is accounted for using the equity method. 


viance
is our 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical. viance markets our timber treatment products. our joint venture interest in viance was acquired as part of the rockwood

acquisition
on october 1, 2014. the joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our harrisburg, north carolina facility, and we bear a
disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on viance's behalf. as a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary
and began consolidating viance upon the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. 







raw materials  

the primary raw materials used in our pigments and additives segment are titanium-bearing ores and iron oxide particles.

primary raw materials
 
titanium bearing ore, sulfuric acid
 
barium and zinc based inorganics
 
iron oxide particles, scrap iron, coppers
 
dcoit, copper, monoethanolamine
 
aluminum oxide



 
in
recent years, we have purchased the majority of our ores under supply contracts from a range of ore suppliers. the majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from india,
africa, canada and norway. ore accounts for approximately 45% of titanium dioxide variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively
account for approximately 30% of variable manufacturing costs. 


the
world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the four largest suppliers (rio tinto, kenmare, iluka and tronox) accounting for approximately 40% of
global supply between them and from whom we purchase approximately 65% of our needs. the majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is now transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term
volume-contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per annum. this form of market-based ore contracts has introduced more flexibility and responsiveness, both in terms of pricing
and quantity obligations. 

titanium
dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process. once an intermediate titanium dioxide
pigment has been produced, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and
chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product's performance characteristics. 

co-products
from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost
competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our pigments and additives segment. we sell over 60% of the co-products generated by our business. 


we
source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from china, the u.s., france and italy. key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced
from various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 







competition  

the global markets in which our pigments and additives segment operates are highly competitive and vary according to product. 

28




 

table of contents

competition
within the standard grade titanium dioxide market is based on price, product quality and service. the major global producers against whom we compete are chemours, tronox,
kronos and cristal, each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets. if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to
produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. moreover, the sulfate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments and additives
segment is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture
improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 

competition
within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and, to a certain extent, price. key competitors for
barium-based additives include solvay s.a., gruppo chimico dalton s.p.a., sakai chemical industry co., ltd. and chinese barium producers. key competitors for zinc-based
additives include chinese lithopone producers. 

competition
within the specialty titanium dioxide market and the color pigments market is based on customer service, product attributes, such as product form and quality, and price.
product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. our primary
competitors within specialty titanium dioxide include fuj titanium industry, kronos and precheza. our primary competitors within color pigments include lanxess ag, cathay pigments group, interstar
materials inc. and shanghai yipin pigments co., ltd. 

competition
within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology and product range. our primary competitors are lonza group and
koppers. 

competition
within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. our primary competitors are kemira and feralco. 







research and development  

for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we spent $160 million, $158 million and
$140 million, respectively, on research and development. 

we
support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. our research and development centers are located in
the woodlands, texas; everberg, belgium; and shanghai, china. other regional development/technical service centers are located in wynyard, england and duisburg, germany (pigments); auburn hills,
michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); derry, new hampshire, shanghai, china, deggendorf, germany and ternate, italy (polyurethanes); melbourne, australia (surfactants); port neches,
texas (process engineering support); basel, switzerland and panyu, china (advanced materials and textile effects); and mumbai, india (textile effects). 







intellectual property rights  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. we own
approximately 440 unexpired u.s. patents, approximately 135 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending at the u.s. patent and trademark office, and approximately 4,180 foreign
issued patents and pending patent applications. while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued u.s. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not 

29




 

table of contents

be
challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will
provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to
lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 


we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. there can be no
assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or
proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. in addition, there can be no assurance that
others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 


in
addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us
to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. we also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to
third parties. 

we
have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 175 u.s. trademark registrations (including applications for registration currently pending at
the u.s. patent and trademark office), and approximately 4,700 foreign trademark registrations and applications for registration. some of these registrations and applications include filings under the
madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. however, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful
protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. 

because
of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for
which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next
several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 







employees  

as of december 31, 2015, we employed approximately 15,000 associates in our operations around the world. approximately 3,000 of
these employees are located in the u.s., while approximately 12,000 are located in other countries. we believe our relations with our employees are good.

environmental, health and safety matters  







general  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety,
pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
waste materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in
addition, our production facilities require operating permits
that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions
or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and
several liability. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or
regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. information related to environmental, health and safety ("ehs") matters may also be found in other
areas of this report including "—item 1a. risk factors," "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies—environmental expenditures" to our consolidated
financial statements and "note 20. environmental health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 







environmental, health and safety systems  

we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable ehs legal requirements, and we have developed policies
and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of
our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are
frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 







environmental remediation  

we have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or
former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior
to the purchase of our businesses. under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 

in
cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we
frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual
covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. we cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will
be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. 

based
on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not
have a 

31




 

table of contents

material
effect on our financial statements. however, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such
costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. at the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate
contamination sites. 







regulatory matters  







greenhouse gas regulation and climate change  

globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("ghgs"), such as
carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the durban negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol in 2012, a limited group of
nations, including the european union, agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the
european union ghg emissions trading system ("ets"), established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the european union, continues in its third phase. the european union
parliament continues with a process to formalized "backloading"—the withholding of ghg allowances to prop up carbon prices. as backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable
solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ets. the european commission proposes to establish a market stability reserve at the beginning of the next
trading period in 2021. in addition, the european union has recently announced the binding target to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. the european
commission proposed an objective of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the european union's energy consumption by 2030. the european council endorsed this target, which is
binding at the european union level. the
european commission also proposed a 30% energy savings target for 2030. the european council, however, endorsed an indicative target of 27% to be reviewed in 2020 having in mind a 30% target. 

federal
climate change legislation in the u.s. appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will continue to be led by the u.s. environmental
protection agency's (the "epa") ghg regulations and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and
operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act's (the "caa")
prevention of significant deterioration requirements under the epa's ghg "tailoring rule." some of our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and any
further regulation may increase our operational costs. 

under
a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the epa is due to propose new source performance standards for ghg emissions from refineries. these standards could
significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. either of these events could have an
adverse effect on our business. 

32






 







































table of contents 

we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol
obligations
and/or ets requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is
possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and/or
increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future
regulation on any of our sites. 

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant
physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our
assets and operations

item 1a.    risk factors        







any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.  







risks related to our business  







our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile
economic conditions.  

our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the u.s., europe and asia. declining economic
conditions in all or any of these locations—or negative perceptions about economic conditions—could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could
adversely affect our business. for example, our operations in asia have been impacted by slower growth in china, which continues to adversely affect demand for some of our products. uncertain economic
conditions and market
instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be
unbalanced at any time. as a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations. we
can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry. 







the markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed
market conditions for such products.  

historically, the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and profit
margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins. for example, recent capacity additions, particularly in china, have
caused supply in the markets for some of our products to outpace demand. the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the supply and demand for products, changes in energy
prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world. for example, demand for our products depends in part on the housing and construction industries. these industries are cyclical
in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy. the cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to
period and over the business cycle. 

in
particular, global prices for titanium dioxide declined throughout 2015 and have remained low in the first quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of oversupply in the market. in
addition, margins for mtbe sales are volatile and seasonal. any continuation of these trends throughout 2016 could negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. 







planned disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities and unplanned disruptions, such as
natural disasters, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.  

manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds and outages. any
serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. alternative
facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, any of which could negatively
impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. long-term 

34




 

table of contents

production
disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability. 

unplanned
production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, supply disruptions particularly from sole-source suppliers, strikes,
transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. in addition, many of our
current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas including the u.s. gulf coast, which is subject to hurricanes. a disaster in one of these regions could have a material
impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. 

in
addition, we rely on a number of vendors suppliers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with
energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities, that we need to operate our business. during periods of economic disruption, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down
their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. if this were to occur, it could adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need,
which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products. moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without
incurring significant delays or cost increases. all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

while
we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances
that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change. in addition, insurance may not
adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not
available at all. furthermore, some potential climate-driven losses, particularly inundation due to sea-level rise, may pose long-term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be
restored in their current locations. 







our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes.  

we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the u.s., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with
international operations. these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which
we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. in addition, we translate our local currency financial results into
u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported
international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer u.s. dollars. because we currently have significant operations located outside the u.s., we are
exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements. 

other
risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and
required compliance with a variety of u.s. and foreign laws, including tax laws, the foreign corrupt practices act (and foreign equivalents), export controls and regulations administered by the office
of foreign assets control. in addition, although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil
sanctions, including 

35




 

table of contents

material
monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where legal processes may
vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices vary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign
receivables through foreign legal systems. the occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability
to make distributions to us. 

we
operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the
jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. in addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap" or "u.s. gaap") have required us to place
valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions. these valuation allowances result from analysis of positive and
negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions. changes in valuation allowances
have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new
valuation allowances. while significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations. 







our efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our
strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  


we continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change. these initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into
partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new
kinds of risks. we have incurred indebtedness to finance these opportunities, and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future initiatives. we could also issue additional shares of stock of
our company or our subsidiaries to finance such initiatives. if our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow
demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted. 


the
implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including:



• diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations; 
• requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses;  
• disruptions to important business relationships; 
• increased operating costs; 
• use of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants; and 
• difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter. 


our
inability to mitigate these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

we may have difficulties integrating acquired businesses and as a result, our business, results of
operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

we have completed a number of acquisitions and we will continue to acquire additional businesses and enter into joint ventures as part
of our business strategy. growth through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks, including:



• inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses and products;  
• inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures;  
• unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business; 
• difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses; 
• difficulties in realizing projected synergies; and 
• exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability or illegal activities conducted
by an acquired company or a joint venture partner. 


our
inability to address these risks could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. 







significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased
costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability.  

the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile. we purchase a substantial portion of
our raw materials from third-party suppliers. the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. the prices for a number of these raw materials generally
follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. for example, the market for crude oil and natural gas
feedstocks experienced depressed pricing throughout 2015 and has remained low in recent months, leading to favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchase from third parties. lower raw
material prices, however, can lead to downward pressure on selling prices for certain of our products leading to reduced revenue. any rebound in the pricing for such feedstocks could adversely affect
our operating expenses. 

in
general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic chemical commodity products that are readily available at market prices. there are, however, several raw
materials for which there are only a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier. we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, evaluate alternative sources of supply and
evaluate alternative technologies to seek to avoid reliance on a limited or sole-source suppliers , but disruptions of existing supply could substantially impact our profitability. if certain of our
suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to
increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. in addition, if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we
may not be 

37




 

table of contents

able
to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes. any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. the
inability of a sole-source supplier to meet our raw material needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations. 


our
supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. while we attempt to match cost increases with
corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract
product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. any cost increase that we are not able to pass on
to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







the industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete
effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies
and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position in various
products and markets throughout the world. in addition, some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. furthermore, some of our competitors
have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. some of our competitors are owned or
partially owned by foreign governments which may provide a competitive advantage to those competitors. while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and
processes, to
improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less
competitive. moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered
uneconomical or obsolete. further, it is possible that we could abandon certain products, processes, or applications due to potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights or that
we could be named in future litigation for the infringement or misappropriation of a competitor's or other third party's intellectual property rights, which could include a claim for injunctive relief
and damages, and, if so, such adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 

certain
of our businesses use technology that is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of our
business, and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing.
further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand their roles significantly in the future. increased competition in any of our
businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.

we may be unable to consummate the separation of our titanium dioxide business on the timeline
currently contemplated, if at all, and such separation, if completed, may not achieve the intended results.  

we remain committed to complete the separation of our titanium dioxide business, and are actively exploring divestment alternatives
that may be completed. our ability to effect such separation is subject to, among other things, market conditions and the approval of our board of directors. we cannot assure you that we will be able
to complete the separation of our titanium dioxide business in a timely fashion, if at all. further, even if such separation is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. any such delays or
difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 







we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to
adequately protect our critical information technology systems could materially affect our operations.  


we rely on information technology systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain and financial information and
various other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. information technology system failures,
network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions
or reporting of financial results. an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning
our customers or employees, which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation. 


we
have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential
information, or disruption of our operations. current employees have, and former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to
our competitors or otherwise used to harm us. moreover, our operations in certain locations, such as china, may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems. any breach of our
security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information, corruption of data or disruption of operations or transactions, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business. 

in
addition, we could be required to expend significant additional amounts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches. we
may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the significant risks to our information technology systems. 







our significant debt level, a portion of which is subject to variable interest rates, makes us
vulnerable to downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to obtain additional financing or to refinance our debt.  


we have significant outstanding debt. as of december 31, 2015, our total consolidated outstanding debt was
$4,795 million (including current portion of debt); our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 74%; our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately
$2.8 billion; and our current portion of debt totaled $170 million. our debt level and the fact that a 

39




 

table of contents

significant
percentage of our cash flow is required to make payments on our debt, could have important consequences for our business, including but not limited to the
following:



• we may be more vulnerable to business, industry or economic downturns, making it more difficult to respond to market conditions;  
• cash flow available for other purposes, including the growth of our business, may be reduced;  
• our ability to refinance or obtain additional financing may be constrained, particularly during periods when the capital markets are
unsettled; 
• our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us; and  
• part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates (for example, a
1% increase in interest rates, without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items, would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $28 million). 


our
debt level also impacts our credit ratings. any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could
result in increased interest and other costs. 







agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or
to obtain additional financing.  

the agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants. these covenants may limit or prohibit our
ability to incur more debt; make certain prepayments of debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; issue stock; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with
affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. some of our strategies may necessitate receiving consents or waivers under our debt
arrangements, which could be withheld. 

our
failure to comply with any of our debt covenants, or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt, could result in a default, or trigger cross-default or
acceleration provisions, under our debt agreements. an event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, cause our creditors to terminate their lending
commitments, or force us or one or more of our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations

if we are unable to execute cost reduction plans successfully, our total operating costs may be
greater than expected, which may adversely affect our profitability.  

from time to time, we undertake actions to restructure our business segments to improve our earnings profile. while we continue to
search for opportunities to reduce our costs and expenses to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the effectiveness of our operations, our success in
achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends upon a number of factors. if we do not successfully execute on our cost reduction initiatives or if we experience delays 

40




 

table of contents

in
completing the implementation of these initiatives, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. 







our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our
profitability.  

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject
to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical products. these hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or
hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. we are also potentially subject to other
hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor
difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. in addition, some equipment and operations at our facilities are owned or controlled by third parties who may not be fully integrated into our
safety programs and over whom we are able to exercise limited control. many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and
environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with
respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters. 

we
maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as
insurance policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. each of
these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. as a result of market conditions, premiums and
deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to
incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. for more information, see
"—item 3. legal proceedings" below. 







we are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated
costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution,
protection of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of
hazardous substances and waste materials. actual or alleged violations of environmental, health and safety, or ehs, laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant
operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some ehs laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. 

many
of our products and operations are subject to the chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. these laws include the regulation of chemical substances and
inventories under the toxic substances control act ("tsca") in the united states and the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals ("reach") regulation in europe. analogous regimes exist 

41




 

table of contents

in
other parts of the world, including china, south korea, and taiwan. in addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the united kingdom, have adopted rules to conform chemical
labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for these rules. additional new laws and
regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. for example, the united states congress is considering an overhaul of the chemical control laws under tsca. the costs of
compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined. 

furthermore,
governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent
regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. in addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our
reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. moreover, changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to
modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our
profitability. 

for
example, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be
contributing to changes in the earth's climate. there are existing efforts to address ghg emissions at the international, national, and regional levels. the 2015 paris climate summit agreement
resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their ghg emissions, and could result in additional firm commitments by various nations with respect to future ghg emissions. the
european union ("eu") regulates ghgs under the eu emissions trading scheme. china has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of ghg emissions in selected areas. in august 2015, the epa
issued its final clean power plan rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called co2 emission performance rates. depending on how states decide to implement these
rules, they may result in national or regional trading schemes. collectively, these rules and agreements may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for
products that contribute to
energy efficiency and renewable energy. these various regulations and agreements are likely to result in increased costs to purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification
of ghg emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use. compliance with these
regulations and any more stringent restrictions in the future may increase our operational costs. 

in
addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes increase the frequency and severity of storms,
droughts, floods and other climatic events. if any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 


we
could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws. capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving
regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. capital expenditures and costs beyond those
currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws. 

furthermore,
we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or
arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond
those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws.

our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims
against us, including antitrust claims.  

we face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property
and environmental claims. it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity, or which may be beyond the
amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies, and we have been named as a
defendant in the antitrust suits discussed in "—item 3. legal proceedings—antitrust matters." in this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages,
which may be significant. an adverse outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







financial difficulties and related problems at our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business
partners could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

during periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including
bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability. a
significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk
relating to that customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. 







our business is dependent on our intellectual property. if our intellectual property rights cannot
be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.  


proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. while a presumption of
validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the u.s., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable.
furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our
intellectual property, then our ability to compete may be adversely affected. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully
produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. while it is our
policy to enter into agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be breached, may
not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade
secrets and know-how. in addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 

we
may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation
or infringement in countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to
the same extent as u.s. law. 

43




 

table of contents

the
failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or the failure of adequate legal
remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 








conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability, particularly in certain
energy-producing nations, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business.  

conflicts, military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in financial markets. instability
and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases. the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of
terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers. accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our
suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
addition, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result
in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 







if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make
payment on our debts.  

our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries. because a significant portion
of our operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of
such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries. any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or
advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign
currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our
nonguarantor subsidiaries. in addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings. 

our
subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any
funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. any right that we have to
receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds
from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary. 







regulatory or market changes with respect to mtbe may materially reduce our sales and/or materially
increase our costs.  

we produce mtbe, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of
gasoline. because of the allegations that mtbe has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the u.s. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the u.s.
market. we currently market mtbe, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the u.s. this business has been profitable to us 

44




 

table of contents

over
time, and future legislative or regulatory initiatives or changing consumer opinion outside the u.s. restricting mtbe or changing consumer opinion could materially adversely affect our ability to
market and sell mtbe and our profitability. expansion of our po/mtbe operations, including our joint venture with sinopec in china, will further expose us to these risks. 


while
we could use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe, this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities.
moreover, the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe. 







our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and under certain
circumstances we may have to significantly increase the level of cash funding to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business.  


we have unfunded obligations under our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. the funded status of our pension
plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations. unfavorable returns
on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for our
business. in addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported
funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. 


under
the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, the pension benefit guaranty corporation ("pbgc") has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified
pension plan under limited circumstances. in the event our tax-qualified pension plans are terminated by the pbgc, we could be liable to the pbgc for the entire amount of the underfunding and, under
certain circumstances, the liability could be senior to our notes. 








risks related to our common stock and debt securities  







certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a
takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market
value.  

certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings
of stockholders, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company, even
if some of our stockholders were to consider such a change of control to be beneficial. our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without
stockholder approval. therefore, our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire
us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value. 








we have purchased, and may continue to purchase, a portion of our equity and debt securities, which
could impact the market for our equity and debt securities and likely would negatively affect our liquidity.  

consistent with past practices, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our equity and debt securities in open market
purchases, accelerated repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full calls for redemption or otherwise. any such 

45

repurchases
or redemptions and the timing and amount thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. such transactions could
negatively affect our liquidity.

executive officers of the registrant  

the following is information concerning our executive officers and significant employees as of the date of this report. 


jon m. huntsman, age 78, is the executive chairman of the board of directors of our company. prior to his appointment as executive
chairman in february 2009, mr. huntsman served as chairman of the board of our company since its formation in 2004 and the predecessors to our company since 1970, when he founded his first
plastics company. mr. huntsman served as chief executive officer of our company and our affiliated companies from 1970 to 2000. mr. huntsman is a director or manager, as applicable, of
huntsman international and certain of our other subsidiaries. in addition, mr. huntsman serves or has served as chairman or as a member of numerous corporate, philanthropic and industry boards,
including the american red cross, the wharton school, university of pennsylvania, primary children's medical center foundation, the chemical manufacturers association and the american plastics
council. mr. huntsman was selected in 1994 as the chemical industry's top chief executive officer for all businesses in europe and north america. mr. huntsman was awarded the american

our performance products segment, demand for our specialty products has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp, as overall demand is significantly influenced by new
product and application development. demand for most of our intermediate products has grown in line with gdp growth. over time, demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly
exceed gdp growth. however, maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical given its dependence on the upr market, which is influenced by construction end markets. 

growth
in our polyurethanes and advanced materials segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications, as
well as by the level of global economic activity. historically, demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth. in polyurethanes, this growth, driven largely by asia, has
in recent years resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products, including mdi. mdi does, however, experience some seasonality in its sales
reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets. sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the
second and third quarters of the year. 

demand
in our textile effects segment is driven primarily by consumer activity. consumer spending for goods incorporating our textile effects products is impacted significantly by a
wide range

of
economic factors, including personal incomes, housing and energy prices and other highly volatile factors. accordingly, demand for our textile effects products has been volatile and appears likely
to remain volatile. 

historically,
demand for titanium dioxide pigments and additives has grown at rates approximately equal to gdp growth. pigment prices have historically reflected industry-wide operating
rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers, contract arrangements and
seasonality. the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints, the largest end use for titanium dioxide, generally peak during the spring and summer months in the
northern hemisphere. this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year. 

for
further information regarding sales price and demand trends, see "—results of operations—segment analysis—year ended december 31, 2015
compared to year ended december 31, 2014" and the tables captioned "year ended december 31, 2015 vs. 2014, period-over-period increase (decrease)" and "fourth quarter 2015 vs. third
quarter 2015, period-over-period increase (decrease)" below. 







outlook  

we expect our cyclical businesses, particularly mtbe, ethylene and titanium dioxide, to continue to negatively impact our
profitability in 2016. our differentiated downstream businesses continue to have an attractive growth profile and we expect profitability to continue to improve during 2016, offsetting the impact from
our cyclical businesses. 


we
have a number of initiatives underway that will improve the competitiveness and strength of our entire company and we are investing in growth projects that will improve our
businesses over the next few years. 

our
earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate movements. our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies, including the primary european currencies which
have recently been volatile, while our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. generally, a decline in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar, will reduce the reported profitability of our
polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and pigments and additives segments. a decline in the value of the pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar will increase the reported
profitability of our pigments and additives segment and an increase in the value of the swiss franc relative to the u.s. dollar will reduce the reported profitability of our advanced materials and
textile effects segments. we are also exposed to other foreign currencies including the chinese renminbi, the indian rupiah, the brazilian real and the thai baht. in general, a decline in the value of
these currencies as compared to the u.s. dollar will reduce our reported profitability. 

notwithstanding
near term headwinds and shocks to the business landscape, such as meaningful movements in foreign currency rates and lower priced oil, we believe we are well positioned
to deliver
increased earnings, an improvement in free cash flow and increased stockholder value over the next several years. the following is a summary of the key trends expected in our business segments: 







polyurethanes: 



• 2016 improving mdi urethane demand 
• 2016 adjusted ebitda improvement 

58




 

table of contents



• low po/mtbe margins 








performance products: 



• favorable downstream product margins 
• 2016 benefit of growth projects, such as ethylene oxide expansion in the u.s. and polyetheramines expansion in singapore  
• lower oil prices reduce u.s. gulf coast cost advantage 
• 2016 adjusted ebitda similar to 2015 








advanced materials: 



• strong aerospace market more than one-third of earnings 
• moderate increase in 2016 adjusted ebitda 








textile effects: 



• selective growth above underlying market demand 
• moderate increase in 2016 adjusted ebitda 








pigments and additives: 



• more than $100 million of incremental synergy and restructuring savings 
• stable additives business 
• slightly positive 2016 adjusted ebitda 


we
remain committed to a separation of our titanium dioxide business and are actively exploring additional possibilities outside of an initial public offering or a spin-off. our ability
to effect such separation is subject to, among other things, market conditions and the approval of our board of directors. see "—item 1a. risk factors." 


in
2016, we expect to spend approximately $450 million on capital expenditures, net of reimbursements. 

we
expect our full year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 30% and our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. we believe our long-term effective income tax rate
will be approximately 30%.

nm—not
meaningful 


(1)ebitda
is defined as net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, before interest, income taxes, depreciation
and amortization. because ebitda excludes these items, ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings, fluctuations in interest rates or
effective tax rates, or levels of depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is computed by eliminating the following from ebitda: (a) acquisition and integration expenses and purchase
accounting adjustments; (b) ebitda from discontinued operations; (c) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (d) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (e) certain
legal settlements and related expenses; (f) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (g) net plant incident remediation costs; and (h) restructuring,
impairment, plant closing and transition costs. we believe that net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and
presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda.  


we
believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda supplement an investor's understanding of our financial performance. however, these measures should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes
for net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with gaap. moreover, ebitda and adjusted ebitda
as used herein are not necessarily 


 
63




 

table of contents
 
 

comparable
to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. our management believes these measures are useful to compare general
operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of
different companies because they exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. for example, interest expense can be highly
dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. in addition, the tax positions
of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. as a result, effective
tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets.
this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.  


nevertheless,
our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income
attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance. for example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and
interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda and adjusted ebitda by using these measures to
supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than gaap results alone.  

in
addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe it is
useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific
underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in
future periods, may not be indicative of future results. for example, while ebitda from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or
future results.  



(2)adjusted
net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to huntsman corporation or
huntsman international, as appropriate: (a) acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting adjustments; (b) impact of certain foreign tax credit elections; (c) loss
from discontinued operations; (d) discount amortization on settlement financing; (e) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (f) loss on early extinguishment of debt;
(g) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (h) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (i) net plant incident remediation costs; and
(j) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. the income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the
unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. we do not adjust for changes in tax valuation
allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under gaap. basic adjusted income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net
income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. diluted adjusted income per share reflects all

potential
dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the
number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities.  

adjusted
net income and adjusted income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental disclosures to net income applicable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate,
and income per share because we believe that these measures are indicative of our operating performance. these measures are also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of
different companies because they exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. nevertheless, our management recognizes that there
are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted net income and adjusted income per share in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income attributable to huntsman corporation or
huntsman international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance for example, adjusted net income and adjusted income per share exclude items that may be recurring in nature and
should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other
periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on
specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to current operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring
in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. for example, while loss from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or
future results.  



(3)includes
cost associated with transition activities relating to the migration of our information data centers and the transition of our textile effects
segment's production from basel, switzerland to a tolling facility. these transition costs were included in either selling, general and administrative expenses or cost of sales on our consolidated
statements of operations.
(4)capital
expenditures, net of reimbursements, represent cash paid for capital expenditures less payments received as reimbursements from customers and joint
venture partners. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures of $663 million, $601 million and $471 million, respectively, were reimbursed in part by $15 million,
$37 million and $4 million, respectively.  
 
 





year ended december 31, 2015 compared with year ended december 31, 2014  

for the year ended december 31, 2015, net income attributable to huntsman corporation was $93 million on revenues of
$10,299 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman corporation of $323 million on revenues of $11,578 million for 2014. for the year ended december 31,
2015, net income attributable to huntsman international was $94 million on revenues of $10,299 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman international of
$335 million on revenues of $11,578 million for 2014. the decrease of $230 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the decrease of $241 million in
net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



• revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased by $1,279 million, or 11%, as compared with 2014. the decrease
was due principally to lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices in all our segments. see "—segment analysis" below.

table of contents



• our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased by
$71 million and $75 million, respectively, or 4% each, as compared with 2014. the impact on gross profit resulted from lower gross margins in all of our segments, except for our advanced
materials segment. see "—segment analysis" below. 
• our operating expenses and the operating expenses of huntsman international increased by $13 million and $14 million,
respectively, or 1% each, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily related to the consolidated expenses of the acquired rockwood businesses, offset in part by the
foreign currency exchange impacts of the strengthening u.s. dollar against other major international currencies. 
• restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to $302 million from
$158 million in 2014. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to $31 million from
$28 million in 2014. during 2015, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million related to the redemption of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due 2021 ("2021
senior subordinated notes"). for more information, see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our
consolidated financial statements. 
• our income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to $46 million from $51 million in 2014.
the income tax expense of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to $45 million from $43 million in 2014. the change in income tax expense is
impacted by the benefit in 2015 of generating $14 million of excess u.s. foreign tax credits and in 2014 of utilizing u.s. foreign tax credits which had been subject to a valuation allowance.
excluding the impact of the u.s. foreign tax credits, our income tax expense and the income tax expense of huntsman international decreased by $97 million and $101 million, respectively,
as compared with 2014, primarily due to lower pre-tax income and tax impacts of tax only foreign currency exchange losses. our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in
the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. for further information concerning taxes, see "note 18. income
taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the decrease in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a planned maintenance outage at
our po/mtbe facility in port neches, texas that commenced in the first quarter of 2015 and extended into the second quarter of 2015, lower mdi average selling prices and the foreign currency exchange
impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against other key currencies. po/mtbe sales volumes decreased due to the planned maintenance outage at our po/mtbe facility in port neches, texas. mdi sales volumes
decreased
slightly due to the market slowdown in china and lower sales into commercial construction in the u.s. po/mtbe average selling prices decreased following lower pricing for high octane gasoline. mdi
average selling prices decreased in response to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major european currencies. the decrease in segment
ebitda was due to lower po/mtbe earnings and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against the euro. we estimate the reduction to segment ebitda resulting from the planned
po/mtbe maintenance outage was approximately $90 million for 2015.

the decrease in revenues in our performance products segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower average selling
prices and lower sales volumes. average selling prices decreased across all product lines primarily in response to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s.
dollar against major european currencies. sales volumes decreased across most product lines, including the effect of the sale of our european commodity surfactants business in the second quarter of
2014 partially offset by higher toll volumes in our upstream intermediates business. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins on produced ethylene, partially offset by higher
amines margins and lower restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs. during 2015 and 2014, our performance products segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of
$11 million and $28 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our
consolidated financial statements. 







advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower sales volumes and lower average
selling prices. sales volumes decreased globally primarily in our coatings and construction and transportation and industrial markets due to the de-selection of certain business and competitive
pressure, partially offset by strong volume growth in our do-it-yourself and wind markets in the asia pacific region. average selling prices increased, in most markets, on a local currency basis in
the americas and asia pacific regions due to certain price increase initiatives and our focus on higher value markets; overall this was more than offset by the foreign currency exchange impact of a
stronger u.s. dollar against major international
currencies. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher margins, resulting from lower raw material costs, and our focus on higher value business as well as lower fixed costs. 







textile effects  

the decrease in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower average selling prices and lower
sales volumes. average selling prices decreased in response to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major international currencies. sales
volumes decreased primarily due to the de-selection of certain less profitable business and challenging market conditions. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins and higher
restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs, partially offset by lower fixed costs. during 2015 and 2014, our textile effects segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant
closing and transition costs of $38 million and $28 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and
plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







pigments and additives  

the increase in revenues in our pigments and additives segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the impact of the
rockwood acquisition. other than the impact of the rockwood acquisition, average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of high titanium dioxide industry inventory levels and the foreign
currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major european currencies. sales volumes decreased primarily as a result of lower end-use demand and the impact of a nitrogen tank explosion
owned and operated by a third party at our uerdingen, germany facility, which disrupted our manufacturing during the third quarter of 2015. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower
contribution margin for titanium dioxide, higher acquisition

expenses
and integration costs, higher restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and the negative impact from the manufacturing disruption at our uerdingen, germany facility. during 2015 and
2014, our pigments and additives segment recorded acquisition expenses and integration costs of $44 million and $43 million, respectively. during 2015 and 2014, our pigments and
additives segment
recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $219 million and $60 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11.
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







corporate and other  

corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, last-in first-out ("lifo")
inventory valuation reserve adjustments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unallocated restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, nonoperating income and expense, benzene sales and gains
and losses on the disposition of corporate assets. for 2015, ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman corporation increased by $31 million to a loss of $197 million from a loss of
$228 million for 2014. for 2015, ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman international increased by $30 million to a loss of $200 million from a loss of $230 million
for 2014. the increase in ebitda from corporate and other resulted primarily from a $28 million increase in lifo inventory valuation income ($29 million of income in 2015 compared to
$1 million of income in 2014), a $11 million decrease in unallocated corporate overhead ($178 million of expense in 2015 compared to $189 million of expense in 2014), and a
$5 million decrease in restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs ($8 million of expense in 2015 compared to $13 million of expense in 2014). for more information
concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. the increase in ebitda was partially offset by a
$9 million decrease in ebitda from benzene sales ($9 million of loss in 2015 compared to nil of income in 2014), and a $3 million increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt
($31 million of loss in 2015 compared to $28 million of loss in 2014). for more information concerning the loss on early extinguishment of debt, see "note 14.
debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 







discontinued operations  

the operating results of our former polymers, base chemicals and australian styrenics businesses are classified as discontinued
operations, and, accordingly, the revenues of these businesses are excluded from revenues for all periods presented. the ebitda of these former businesses are included in discontinued operations for
all periods presented. the loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results, legal costs, restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and gain (loss) on disposal with respect
to our former businesses.

huntsman
corporation and the increase of $209 million in net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following
items:



• revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $499 million, or 5%, as compared with 2013. the increase was
due principally to higher average selling prices in our performance products, advanced materials and textile effects segments and higher sales volumes in our polyurethanes and pigments and additives
segments. see "—segment analysis" below. 
• our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by
$166 million and $157 million, respectively, or 9% each, as compared with 2013. the increase resulted from higher gross margins in all our segments, except for our pigments and additives
segment. see "—segment analysis" below. 
• operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $36 million and $37 million, respectively,
or 3% each, as compared with 2013, primarily related to higher acquisition and integration costs and higher foreign currency losses. 
• restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased to $158 million from
$151 million in 2013. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• our interest expense and the interest expense of huntsman international for 2014 increased by $15 million and
$11 million, respectively, or 8% and 5%, respectively, as compared with 2013. the increase was due primarily to additional borrowings in 2014 that were used to fund the rockwood acquisition.  
• loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to $28 million from
$51 million in 2013. the loss in 2014 resulted from the redemption of our 2020 senior subordinated notes. the loss in 2013 resulted primarily from the repurchase of the remainder of our 5.50%
senior notes due 2016 ("2016 senior notes"). for more information, see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of
debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 
• our income tax expense decreased and the income tax expense of huntsman international decreased by $74 million and
$94 million, respectively, as compared with 2013, primarily due to the benefit of utilizing u.s. foreign tax credits, which had been subject to a valuation allowance. excluding the impact of
the u.s. foreign tax credits, our income tax expense increased and the income tax expense of huntsman international increased by $40 million and $41 million, respectively, as compared
with 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2014, excluding the impact of the benefit of our u.s. foreign tax credits, our effective tax rate was 39%, which is lower than our effective tax rate
of 45% for 2013, primarily due to various valuation allowance releases in 2014 and because our textile effects segment's restructuring charges in 2013 received nominal tax benefit. our tax expense is
significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. for further
information concerning taxes, see "note 18. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the increase in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved
sales mix, partially offset by lower average selling prices. mdi sales volumes increased due to improved demand in the americas and asian regions and across most major markets. po/mtbe sales volumes
decreased primarily as a result of two manufacturing disruptions at our port neches, texas facility in the second and third quarters of 2014. po/mtbe average selling prices decreased primarily due to
less favorable market
conditions. mdi average selling prices increased in the americas and european regions, partially offset by lower component pricing in china. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower
po/mtbe earnings, partially offset by higher mdi sales margins. during 2014 and 2013, our polyurethanes segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $19 million and
$2 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial
statements. 







performance products  

the increase in revenues in our performance products segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher average selling
prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes and unfavorable changes in sales mix. average selling prices increased in response to higher raw material costs and continued strong market conditions
for amines, maleic anhydride and specialty surfactants. sales volumes decreased primarily due to a decline in sales volumes of surfactants, which resulted from the restructuring of our european
surfactants business, partially offset by an increased demand for amines and maleic anhydride. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to the impact of our scheduled maintenance in the first
quarter of 2013, estimated at $55 million, and increased margins in amines and maleic anhydride, partially offset by higher restructuring charges. during 2014 and 2013, our performance products
segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $28 million and $18 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see
"note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.

advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower sales volumes,
partially offset by higher average selling prices and improved sales mix. sales volumes decreased primarily in our coatings and construction market due to our restructuring efforts, partially offset
by higher demand in the wind market in the americas and asia pacific regions. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we closed two of our base resins production units as we focus on higher value markets,
such as aerospace and transportation and industrial. during 2014, we also experienced an unplanned production outage due to a raw materials supply disruption in the americas region. average selling
prices increased in all regions and across
most markets primarily due to certain price increase initiatives and a focus on higher value markets. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher margins, improved sales mix, lower
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and lower selling, general and administrative costs as a result of recent restructuring efforts. during 2014 and 2013, our advanced materials segment
recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $11 million and $34 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11.
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







textile effects  

the increase in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher average selling prices,
partially offset by lower sales volumes. average selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material costs. sales volumes decreased primarily due to the de-selection of lower value
business. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher margins, lower manufacturing costs and lower restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs, partially offset by
higher selling, general and administrative costs. during 2014 and 2013, our textile effects segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs of $28 million and
$87 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial
statements. 







pigments and additives  

the increase in revenues in our pigments and additives segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the impact of the
rockwood acquisition. other than the impact of the rockwood acquisition, sales volumes remained flat as a result of higher end-use demand in the european and north american regions, offset by lower
demand in the africa, latin america and middle east regions. average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of high industry inventory levels, partially offset by the strength of the euro
against the u.s. dollar. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins, higher acquisition expenses and integration costs and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by lower
selling, general and administrative costs. during 2014 and 2013, our pigments and additives segment recorded acquisition expenses and integration costs of $43 million and $8 million,
respectively. during 2014 and 2013, our pigments and additives segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $60 million and $4 million, respectively. for more
information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.

corporate and other for huntsman corporation increased by $33 million to a loss of $228 million from a loss of $261 million for 2013. for 2014, ebitda from corporate and other for
huntsman international increased by $32 million to a loss of $230 million from a loss of $262 million for 2013. the increase in ebitda from corporate and other resulted primarily
from a decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt of $23 million ($28 million loss in 2014 compared to $51 million loss in 2013). for more information regarding the loss on
early extinguishment of debt, see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial
statements. the increase in ebitda also resulted from a $7 million decrease in loss from benzene sales (nil in 2014 compared to $7 million loss in 2013), a $6 million decrease in
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs ($13 million of expense in 2014 compared to $19 million of expense in 2013) and a decrease in legal settlements of $5 million
(nil in 2014 compared to $5 million of expense in 2013). for more information concerning restructuring activities see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our
consolidated financial statements. the increase in ebitda was partially offset by an increase in unallocated foreign exchange losses of $5 million ($5 million loss in 2014 compared to
nil in 2013) and an increase in global information technology transition costs of $3 million ($3 million of expense in 2014 compared to nil in 2013).

net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 and 2014 was $575 million and $760 million, respectively. the
decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily attributable to lower net income as described in "—results of operations" above and a
$24 million unfavorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2015 as compared with 2014. 

net
cash used in investing activities for 2015 and 2014 was $600 million and $1,606 million, respectively. during 2015 and 2014, we paid $663 million and

table of contents 

net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for 2015 and 2014 was $(562) million and $1,197 million, respectively. the decrease in
net cash
provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher net borrowings during 2014, primarily used to fund the rockwood acquisition and an increase in repayments of long-term debt in 2015. on
march 31, 2015, we issued €300 million (approximately $326 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2025 ("2025 senior
notes"). on april 17, 2015, we used the net proceeds of this offering to redeem $289 million ($294 million carrying value) of our 2021 senior subordinated notes. in the third
quarter of 2015, we redeemed the remaining $195 million ($198 million carrying value) of our 2021 senior subordinated notes. during 2015, we repurchased $100 million of our common
stock. 







cash flows for year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended
december 31, 2013  

net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 and 2013 was $760 million and $708 million, respectively. the
increase in net cash provided by operating activities
during 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in net income as described in "—results of operations" above, offset in part by a $61 million unfavorable
variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2014 as compared with 2013. 

net
cash used in investing activities for 2014 and 2013 was $1,606 million and $566 million, respectively. during 2014 and 2013, we paid $601 million and
$471 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. during 2014, we paid $1.04 billion for rockwood's performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses and during 2013 we paid
$66 million for the acquisition of businesses. during 2014 and 2013, we made investments in louisiana pigment company, l.p. of $37 million and $60 million, respectively,
and in nanjing jinling huntsman new materials co., ltd of $62 million and $37 million, respectively, and we received dividends from louisiana pigment company, l.p.
of $48 million and $71 million, respectively. 

net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2014 and 2013 was $1,197 million and $(6) million, respectively. the increase in net cash provided by financing activities

table of contents

our
working capital decreased by $790 million as a result of the net impact of the following significant changes:



• the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $603 million resulted from the matters identified on our consolidated statements
of cash flows. 
• accounts and notes receivable decreased by $258 million mainly due to lower revenues in the three months ended
december 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended december 31, 2014 and the appreciation in value of the u.s. dollar. 
• inventories decreased by $333 million mainly due to lower raw material costs and the appreciation in value of the u.s. dollar.  
• prepaid expenses increased primarily due to the prepayment of $49 million of employee termination and other restructuring costs
related to the restructuring of our pigments and additives, textile effects and performance products segments. for more information, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing
costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 
• effective october 1, 2015, we adopted accounting standard update ("asu") no. 2015-17, income
taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. the amendments in this asu require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on
the statement of financial position. we adopted the amendments in this asu on a prospective basis and classified all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent on our balance sheet for 2015
only. 
• the decrease in accounts payable of $214 million was primarily due to lower purchases consistent with the lower inventory
balances noted above and the appreciation in value of the u.s. dollar. 
• current portion of debt decreased by $97 million primarily due to the 2015 reclassification of loan commitments of arabian
amines company, our 50%-owned consolidated joint venture, as long-term debt. these loan commitments were classified as current portion of debt at december 31, 2014.

short-term and long-term liquidity  

we depend upon our cash, credit facilities, accounts receivable securitization programs ("a/r programs") and other debt instruments to
provide liquidity for our operations and working capital needs. as of december 31, 2015, we had $1,023 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity, consisting of
$269 million in cash and restricted cash, $610 million in availability under our revolving facility ("revolving facility"), and $144 million in availability under our a/r
programs. our liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors. the following matters had, or are expected to have, a significant impact on our
liquidity:



• cash from our accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable, was approximately $143 million for 2015, as reflected
in our consolidated statements of cash flows. we expect volatility in our working capital components to continue. 
• during 2016, we expect to spend approximately $450 million on capital expenditures, net of reimbursements. our future
expenditures include certain ehs maintenance and upgrades; periodic maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing

facilities;
expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities; certain cost reduction projects; and certain information technology expenditures. we expect to fund this spending
with cash provided by operations. 



• during 2015, we made contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans of $106 million. during 2016, we expect to
contribute an additional amount of approximately $75 million to these plans. 
• we are also involved in a number of cost reduction programs for which we have established restructuring accruals. as of
december 31, 2015, we had $167 million of accrued restructuring costs from continuing operations, and we expect to incur and pay additional restructuring and plant closing costs of
approximately $9 million in 2016. for further discussion of these plans and the costs involved, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated
financial statements. 
• on september 29, 2015, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our
common stock. on october 27, 2015, we entered into and funded an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $100 million of our common stock. the accelerated share repurchase
agreement was completed in january 2016 with the purchase of approximately 8.6 million shares of huntsman corporation common stock. for more information, see "note 21. huntsman
corporation stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements. our company has the remaining $50 million available under this authorization to purchase additional shares. 


as
of december 31, 2015, we had $170 million classified as current portion of debt, including $50 million of our term loan c facility ("term loan c") due
june 30, 2016, debt at our variable interest entities of $14 million, a short term borrowing facility in china totaling $47 million, our scheduled senior credit facilities
("senior credit facilities") amortization payments totaling $25 million, our annual financing of various insurance premiums totaling $15 million, and certain other short-term facilities
and scheduled amortization payments totaling $19 million. although we cannot provide assurances, we intend to renew or extend the majority of these short-term facilities in the current period. 

as
of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $217 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries, including our
variable interest entities. additionally, we have material intercompany debt obligations owed to us by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we intend to use cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to fund our
local operations. nevertheless, we could repatriate cash as dividends or as repayments of intercompany debt. if foreign cash were repatriated as dividends, the dividends could be subject to u.s.
federal and state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief. at present, we estimate that we will generate sufficient cash in our u.s. operations, together with the payments of
intercompany debt, if necessary, to meet our cash needs in the u.s. and we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. as dividends. cash held by certain foreign subsidiaries, including our variable
interest entities, may also be subject to legal restrictions, including those arising from the interests of our partners, which could limit the amounts available for repatriation.

minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $2 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases.
(3)we
have various purchase commitments extending through 2029 for materials, supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. included
in the purchase commitments table above are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2016. certain contracts
allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period, such notice period
has been included in the above table. the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations. we have estimated
our contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased. we
believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made minimum payments of nil, nil and
$7 million, respectively, under such take or pay contracts without taking the product.

restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs  

since the rockwood acquisition, our pigments and additives segment has been involved in a cost reduction program expected to reduce
costs by approximately $140 million and improve its global competitiveness. in addition, we have announced a capacity reduction at our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in calais, france
expected to generate approximately $35 million of annual savings. these cost savings are expected to be achieved by the middle of 2016. 

for
a discussion of restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







legal proceedings  

for a discussion of legal proceedings, see "note 19. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our
consolidated financial statements. 







environmental, health and safety matters  

as noted above in "part i. item 1. business—environmental, health and safety matters" and "part i.
item 1a, "risk factors," we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. while we do not expect any of
these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial
condition. for a discussion of environmental, health and safety
matters, see "note 20. environmental, health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 







recently issued accounting pronouncements  

for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see "note 2. summary of significant accounting
policies—recently issued accounting pronouncements" to our consolidated financial statements. 







critical accounting policies  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. our significant accounting policies are summarized in "note 2. summary of
significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. summarized below are our critical accounting policies: 







employee benefit programs  

we sponsor several contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans, covering employees primarily in the u.s., the u.k., the
netherlands, belgium and switzerland, but also covering employees in a number of other countries. we fund the material plans through trust arrangements (or local equivalents) where the assets are held
separately from us. we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the u.s., canada and south africa.
amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries. inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions
regarding expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, compensation increases, mortality rates and health care cost trends. these assumptions are described in "note 17.
employee benefit plans" to our consolidated financial statements. 

81






 







































table of contents 


management, with the advice of actuaries, uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations
and
expenses are based. the effect of a 1% change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

goodwill  

we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. approximately 68%
of our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit. the remaining goodwill relates to three other reporting units. 


fair
value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. the estimated fair values of our reporting units are
dependent on several significant assumptions including, among others, market information, operating results, earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows. 

we
tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2015 as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
our most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amounts of all reporting units by a significant margin. 







income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they
will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the
realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we
consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider
other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable 

82




 

table of contents

jurisdictions
could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2015, we had total valuation allowances of $784 million. see "note 18.
income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our valuation allowances. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that are reinvested
and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. we have material intercompany debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation, combined with the ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of intercompany debt owed by
our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend we will utilize our intercompany debt. if any earnings
were repatriated via dividend, we may need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. as discussed in "note 18. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements, we made a distribution
of a portion of our earnings in 2015 and 2013 when the amount of foreign tax credits associated with the distribution was greater than the amount of tax otherwise due. the undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries with positive earnings that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately $354 million at december 31, 2015. it is not practicable to determine the
unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings because of the significant assumptions necessary to compute the tax. 

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to
be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions
and the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in order to
measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing
authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized
in our consolidated financial statements. 







long-lived assets  

the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience, engineering estimates and
industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets. the estimated lives of our property range from 3 to
50 years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method. inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual
capital expenditures will be performed. without on-going capital improvements and maintenance, the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter. 

management
uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. at december 31, 2015, if the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment had
either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives, then depreciation expense for 2015 would have been approximately $35 million less or $41 million greater,
respectively. 

83




 

table of contents

we
are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or
when management's plans change regarding those assets, such as idling or closing a plant. we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values. key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life, technology, competitive pressures, raw
material pricing and regulations. in connection with our asset evaluation policy, we reviewed all of our long-lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. during 2015,
we recorded an impairment charge of $19 million related to the impairment of our pigments and additives south african asset group. see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant
closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







restructuring and plant closing costs  

we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations, workforce reductions and
other cost savings programs in each of
our business segments. these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan. estimates for plant closing costs include the write-off of the
carrying value of the plant, any necessary environmental and/or regulatory costs, contract termination and demolition costs. estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded
based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated, termination benefits to be provided and other information, as necessary. management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and
will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the currently recorded estimate. for further discussion of our restructuring activities, see "note 11.
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







contingent loss accruals  

environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation, available technology, site-specific information and remediation alternatives. we accrue an
amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information. the extent of environmental impacts may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation
may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available, technology that
can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage. adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses. for
further information, see "note 20. environmental, health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 


we
are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of
probable losses. a determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. we have an active risk management program
consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. these policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. the
required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. for further information, see "note 19. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our
consolidated financial statements.

revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we recognize revenue
when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, collectability is
reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 







variable interest entities—primary beneficiary  

we evaluate each of our variable interest entities on an on-going basis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary.
management assesses, on an on-going basis, the nature of our relationship to the variable interest entity, including the amount of control that we exercise over the entity as well as the amount of
risk that we bear and rewards we receive in regards to the entity, to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. management judgment is required to assess whether
these attributes are significant. we consolidate all variable interest entities for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary.  

 
item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk        


we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. from time to time, we
enter into transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations. changes in the
fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 







interest rate risks  

through our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio,
including the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as well as
entering into interest rate derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate long-term debt. under
interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount. 

huntsman
international has entered into several interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our
senior credit facilities. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income

beginning
in 2009, arabian amines company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed payment of
5.02%. in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable
interest entities" to our consolidated financial statements. the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2015 was $24 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as
a cash flow hedge. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the swap was $2 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded as other current liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheets. for 2015 and 2014, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of $1 million and $1 million, respectively, due to changes in fair value of the swap. 

for
the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) associated with these cash flow hedging activities were gains of
approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. 


during
2016, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 







foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in
various currencies. we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency
cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions,
principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would
eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $176 million and $179 million notional
amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding, respectively, in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed u.s. dollar payments of $5 million semiannually on may 15 and november 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately €3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). as of december 31, 2015 the fair value of this swap was $28 million and
was recorded in noncurrent assets. 

86




 

table of contents

on
march 17, 2010, we entered into three five year cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional $350 million for an aggregate notional
€255 million. this swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. as of december 31, 2014, the fair value of this swap was
$43 million, and was recorded in current assets. during the three months
ended march 31, 2015, we terminated these cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $66 million in payments from the counterparties. 

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2015, we have designated
approximately €751 million (approximately $821 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. for the
years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amount of gain (loss) recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $68 million, $97 million and $(22) million, respectively,
and was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately €1,213 million (approximately $1,325 million) in net euro
assets. 







commodity prices risk  

inherent in our business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. however, our exposure to changing commodity prices is
somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are
largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures.

item 9a.    controls and procedures        








evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act) as of december 31, 2015. based on
this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of december 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the sec's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 







changes in internal control over financial reporting  

no changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2015 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act). 








management's report on internal control over financial reporting  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control
framework and processes for our company and huntsman international are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management, huntsman international's board of managers and our board of directors
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of
america. 

our
internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international includes those policies and procedures that:



• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of our company and huntsman international; 
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded properly to allow for the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company and huntsman international are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of our company and huntsman international; 
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and 
• provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud.

table of contents

because
of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. further,
because of changing conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 


our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international and concluded that, as of december 31, 2015,
such internal control is effective. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in  internal control—integrated framework
(2013) ("coso"). 

our
independent registered public accountants, deloitte & touche llp, with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee, have audited our
consolidated financial statements prepared by our company and huntsman international and have issued attestation reports on internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman
international.

management's process to assess the effectiveness ofinternal control over financial reporting        


to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we completed a comprehensive compliance
process to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international. we involved employees at all levels of our company during 2015 in training, performing and
evaluating our internal controls. 

our
management's conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the five elements of coso. our
management considered information from multiple sources as the basis its conclusion—including self-assessments of the control activities within each work process, assessments of
division-level and entity-level controls and internal control attestations from key external service providers, as well as from key management. in addition, our internal control processes contain
self-monitoring mechanisms, and proactive steps are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. we also maintain an internal
auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting within each of the five coso elements.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2015, based on criteria established in  internal control—integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 


because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on the criteria established
in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. 

we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement

report of independent registered public accounting firm  

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015. our audits also included the
financial statement
schedules listed in the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. 


we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries as of
december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 


we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 16, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm  

to
the board of managers and members of
huntsman international llc and subsidiaries 


we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended december 31, 2015. our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 


we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 


in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries as of
december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 


we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 16, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

1. general  







definitions  

for convenience in this report, the terms "company," "our" or "we" may be used to refer to huntsman corporation and, unless the
context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries and predecessors. any references to our "company" "we" "us" or "our" as of a date prior to october 19, 2004 (the date of our company's formation)
are to huntsman holdings, llc and its subsidiaries (including their respective predecessors). in this report, "huntsman international" refers to huntsman international llc (our 100%
owned subsidiary) and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries; "hps" refers to huntsman polyurethanes shanghai ltd. (our consolidated splitting joint venture with shanghai
chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd); and "slic" refers to shanghai liengheng isocyanate company (our unconsolidated manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies). 

in
this report, we may use, without definition, the common names of competitors or other industry participants. we may also use the common names or abbreviations for certain chemicals
or products. 







description of business  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our products comprise a
broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those
in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power
generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride,
epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. 

we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced
materials and textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces inorganic chemical products. in a series of transactions
beginning in 2006, we sold or shutdown substantially all of our australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations. we report the results of these businesses
as discontinued operations. 







company  

our company, a delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the huntsman businesses. jon m. huntsman founded the predecessor to
our company in 1970 as a small packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 

f-17




 

table of contents

currently,
we operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in
1999. 







huntsman corporation and huntsman international financial statements  


except where otherwise indicated, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both our company and huntsman
international. the differences between our consolidated financial statements and huntsman international's consolidated financial statements relate primarily to the
following:



• purchase accounting recorded at our company for the 2003 step-acquisition of huntsman international holdings llc, the former
parent company of huntsman international that was merged into huntsman international in 2005; 
• the different capital structures; and 
• a note payable from huntsman international to us. 








2. summary of significant accounting policies  







asset retirement obligations  

we accrue for asset retirement obligations, which consist primarily of landfill capping, closure and post-closure costs, asbestos
abatement costs, demolition and removal costs and leasehold remediation costs, in the period in which the obligations are incurred. asset retirement obligations are accrued at estimated fair value.
when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. over time, the liability is accreted to its estimated settlement
value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement
amount and the liability recorded. 







carrying value of long-lived assets  

we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability is based upon current and anticipated undiscounted cash flows, and we recognize an impairment when such estimated cash
flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between carrying value and fair value. fair value is generally
estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved or selling price of assets held for sale. see "note 11. restructuring, impairment
and plant closing costs." 







cash and cash equivalents  

we consider cash in checking accounts and cash in short-term highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or
less at the date of purchase, to be cash and cash equivalents. cash flows from discontinued operations are not presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 

f-18




 

table of contents







cost of goods sold  

we classify the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products as cost of goods sold. manufacturing costs include variable
costs, primarily raw materials and energy, and fixed expenses directly associated with production. manufacturing costs also include, among other things, plant site operating costs and overhead
(including depreciation), production planning and logistics costs, repair and maintenance costs, plant site purchasing costs, and engineering and technical support costs. distribution, freight and
warehousing costs are also included in cost of goods sold. 







derivatives and hedging activities  

all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. if the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects
earnings. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain international operations are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent effective. the effectiveness
of a cash flow hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge, and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three months. a derivative designated as a
cash flow hedge is determined to be effective if the change in value of the
hedge divided by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of 80% to 125%. hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative
hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction. for a derivative that does not qualify or has not been designated as a hedge, changes in
fair value are recognized in earnings. 







environmental expenditures  

environmental related restoration and remediation costs are recorded as liabilities when site restoration and environmental
remediation and clean-up obligations are either known or considered probable and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. other environmental expenditures that are principally maintenance or
preventative in nature are recorded when expended and incurred and are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. see "note 20. environmental, health and safety matters." 







foreign currency translation  

the accounts of our operating subsidiaries outside of the u.s., unless they are operating in highly inflationary economic
environments, consider the functional currency to be the currency of the economic environment in which they operate. accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at the
balance sheet date. revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at a weighted average rate for the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded to equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

if
a subsidiary operates in an economic environment that is considered to be highly inflationary (100% cumulative inflation over a three-year period), the u.s. dollar is considered to
be the functional currency and gains and losses from remeasurement to the u.s. dollar from the local currency are included in the statement of operations. where a subsidiary's operations are
effectively run, managed, financed and contracted in u.s. dollars, such as certain finance subsidiaries outside of the u.s., the u.s. dollar is considered to be the functional currency. 

f-19




 

table of contents

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other operating (income) expense in our consolidated statements of operations and were net losses of $7 million,
$15 million and $11 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 







income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they
will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the
realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we
consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence
such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. 

we
do not provide for income taxes or benefits on the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be
reinvested indefinitely. 

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to
be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions
and the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions to measure the
amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities.
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our
consolidated financial statements. 







intangible assets and goodwill  

intangible assets are stated at cost (fair value at the time of acquisition) and are amortized using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives or the life of the related agreement as follows: 
 













patents and technology
 
5 - 30 years


trademarks
 
9 - 30 years


licenses and other agreements
 
5 - 15 years


other intangibles
 
5 - 15 years



 
goodwill
represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not subject to any method of amortization, but is tested for
impairment annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related reporting unit, we are required to 

f-20




 

table of contents

reduce
the amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings. fair value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. goodwill has
been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. the net change to goodwill in response to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2015 was $6 million. 








inventories  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using lifo, first-in first-out, and average costs methods
for different components of inventory. 







legal costs  

we expense legal costs, including those legal costs incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. 








net income per share attributable to huntsman corporation  

basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to huntsman corporation common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. diluted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is
computed by dividing net income available to huntsman corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional
shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. 

basic
and diluted income per share is determined using the following information (in millions):

additional
stock-based awards of 6.1 million, 1.0 million and 7.3 million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the years ended
december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. however, these stock-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the respective periods mentioned because
the effect would be anti-dilutive. 







other noncurrent assets  

other noncurrent assets consist primarily of spare parts, the overfunded portion related to defined benefit plans for employees and
capitalized turnaround costs.

principles of consolidation  

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and any variable
interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 







property, plant and equipment  


property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives or lease term as follows: 
 













buildings and equipment
 
5 - 50 years


plant and equipment
 
3 - 30 years


furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements
 
5 - 20 years



 
interest
expense capitalized as part of plant and equipment was $22 million, $16 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. 

periodic
maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities (a "turnaround") are accounted for on the deferral basis by capitalizing the costs of the
turnaround and amortizing the costs over the estimated period until the next turnaround. normal maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred. renewals, betterments
and major repairs that materially extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized, and the assets replaced, if any, are retired. 







reclassifications  

certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation. effective october 1, 2015, we retroactively applied, and information in this report reflects, the presentation and disclosure requirements of asu no. 2015-03,  interest—imputation of interest
(subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. see "—recently issued
accounting pronouncements." 







revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we recognize revenue
when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, collectability is
reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 







securitization of accounts receivable  

under our a/r programs, we grant an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables to the u.s. spe and the eu spe. this
undivided interest serves as security for the issuance of debt. the a/r programs provide for financing in both u.s. dollars and euros. the amounts outstanding under our a/r programs are accounted for
as secured borrowings. see "note 14. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—a/r programs." 







stock-based compensation  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of
the award. that cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. see "note 22. stock-based compensation plan."

use of estimates  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. 







recently issued accounting pronouncements  







accounting pronouncements adopted during 2015  

in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu no. 2014-08, presentation
of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity,
changing the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhancing reporting requirements for discontinued operations. a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an
entity will be required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results.
further, the amendments in this asu will require an entity to present, for each comparative period, the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in
the asset and liability sections, respectively, of the statement of financial position. the amendments in this asu are effective prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale)
of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, and for all businesses that, on acquisition, are
classified as held for sale that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective
january 1, 2015, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


in
april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, interest—imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt
issuance costs. the amendments in this asu require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from
the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, and that amortization of debt issuance costs shall be reported as interest expense. the recognition and measurement guidance
for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this asu. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
december 15, 2015, with early application permitted. entities would apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective
october 1, 2015 and have presented debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt in our consolidated financial statements retrospectively to all prior periods. debt
issuance costs were previously presented as other noncurrent assets in our consolidated financial statements. 

in
september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, business combinations (topic 805): simplifying the accounting for measurement-period
adjustments. the amendments in this asu require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement
period in the current reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. the amendments in this asu also
require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been
recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. the amendments in this 

f-23




 

table of contents

asu
should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this asu with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been
issued. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective october 1, 2015, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

in
november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. the
amendments in this asu require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. the amendments in this asu are effective for
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the
beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. the amendments in this asu may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods
presented. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective october 1, 2015 and have classified, on a prospective basis, all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent on our consolidated
financial statements. 







accounting pronouncements pending adoption in future periods  

in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic
606), outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue
recognition guidance. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective
date, deferring the effective date of asu no. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. the amendments in these asus are effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 should be applied retrospectively, and early application is permitted.
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the amendments in asu no. 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statements—going concern (subtopic 205-40): disclosure of
uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, providing guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt
about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. the amendments in this asu are effective for the annual period ending after december 15,
2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

in
january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-01, income statement—extraordinary and unusual items (subtopic 225-20): simplifying income
statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items, eliminating from us gaap the concept of extraordinary items. reporting entities will no longer
have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after december 15, 2015. a reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively or may also apply them retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. early
adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
february 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis. the
amendments in this asu change the analysis that a reporting entity 

f-24




 

table of contents

must
perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. these amendments
affect areas specific to limited partnerships and similar legal entities, evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or service provider as a variable interest, the effects of both fee arrangements and
related parties on the primary beneficiary determination and certain investment funds. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after december 15, 2015. a reporting entity may apply the amendments retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period provided that any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


in
april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-05, intangibles—goodwill and other—internal-use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's
accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. the amendments in this asu provide guidance that will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a
customer in a cloud computing arrangement, including
whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license consistent
with the acquisition of other software licenses; otherwise, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. entities can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively to all arrangements entered into after the
effective date or retrospectively to all prior periods. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, inventory (topic 330): simplifying the measurement of inventory. the amendments in
this asu do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (lifo) or the retail inventory method, but rather does apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is
measured using first-in, first-out (fifo) or average cost. an entity should measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling
prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using lifo or the
retail inventory method. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016. the amendments in this asu
should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


in
january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments—overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial
assets and financial liabilities. the amendments in this asu require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result
in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. the amendments allow equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair
values to be remeasured at fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of an impairment. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years
beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption of the amendments in the asu is not permitted. an entity should apply the amendments by
means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. the amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values
(including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments

rockwood acquisition  

on october 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses of rockwood
holdings, inc. we paid $1.02 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded pension liabilities in connection with the rockwood acquisition. the acquisition was financed using a bank term
loan. the majority of the acquired businesses have been integrated into our pigments and additives segment. transaction costs charged to expense related to this acquisition were approximately nil,
$24 million and $8 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our
consolidated statements of operations. 

the
following businesses were acquired from rockwood:



• titanium dioxide, a white pigment derived from titanium bearing ores with strong specialty business in fibers, inks, pharmaceuticals,
food and cosmetics; 
• functional additives made from barium and zinc based inorganics used to make colors more brilliant, primarily in plastics, coatings,
films, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and paper; 
• color pigments made from synthetic iron-oxide and other non-tio2 inorganic pigments used by manufacturers of coatings and colorants;  
• timber treatment wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications;  
• water treatment products used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications; and  
• specialty automotive molded components. 


in
connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the rockwood acquisition, we sold our tio2 tr52 product line used in printing inks to henan in december
2014. the sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply tr52 product to henan during a transitional period. 

we
have accounted for the rockwood acquisition using the acquisition method. as such, we analyzed the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the

during
the second quarter of 2015, we received $18 million related to the settlement of certain purchase price adjustments. as a result of the finalization of the valuation of
the assets and liabilities, reallocations were made in certain property, plant and equipment, deferred tax, accrued liability and other long-term liability balances. none of the fair value of this
acquisition was allocated to goodwill. intangible assets acquired consist primarily of developed technology, trademarks and customer relationships, all of which are being amortized over nine years.
the noncontrolling interest primarily relates to viance, a 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical acquired as part of the rockwood acquisition. the noncontrolling interest was valued at 50% of the
fair value of the net assets of viance as of october 1, 2014, as dictated by the ownership interest percentages. if the rockwood acquisition were to have occurred on january 1, 2013, the

oxid acquisition  

on august 29, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the chemical business of oxid l.p. (the "oxid acquisition"). the
acquisition cost of approximately $76 million consisted of cash payments of approximately $66 million and contingent consideration of $10 million. the contingent consideration
related to an earn-out agreement which would be paid over two years if certain conditions were met. related to this earn-out agreement, $6 million was paid during 2014 and the balance has been
paid in 2015. the acquired business has been integrated into our polyurethanes segment. transaction costs charged to expense related to this acquisition were not significant.

account for this investment at fair value as an available-for-sale equity security. see "note 16. fair value."  


 
in
november 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec (nanjing jingling). the joint venture involves the construction and operation of a po/mtbe
facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51% interest. our total equity investment is anticipated to be approximately
$85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. at the end of 2015, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture.
construction on the project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, with start-up expected in the first half of 2017. 







7. variable interest entities  

we evaluate our investments and transactions to identify variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. we hold
a variable interest in the following joint ventures for which we are the primary beneficiary:



• rubicon llc manufactures products for our polyurethanes and performance products segments. the structure of the joint venture
is such that the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its activities without additional financial support. by virtue of the operating agreement with
this joint venture, we purchase a majority of the output, absorb a majority of the operating costs and provide a majority of the additional funding. 
• pacific iron products sdn bhd manufactures products for our pigments and additives segment. in this joint venture we supply all the
raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers. through a fixed price raw materials supply contract
with the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. 
• arabian amines company manufactures products for our performance products segment. as required in the operating agreement governing
this joint venture, we purchase all of arabian amines company's production and sell it to our customers. substantially all of the joint venture's activities are conducted on our behalf.  
• sasol-huntsman is our 50%-owned joint venture with sasol that owns and operates a maleic anhydride facility in moers, germany. this
joint venture manufactures products for our performance products segment. the joint venture uses our technology and expertise, and we bear a disproportionate amount of risk of loss due to a
related-party loan to sasol-huntsman for which we bear the default risk. 
• viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical. viance markets timber treatment products for our pigments and additives
segment. our joint venture interest in viance was acquired as part of the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. the joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing
arrangement at our harrisburg, north carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on viance's
behalf. as a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and began consolidating viance upon the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014.

12. asset retirement obligations  

asset retirement obligations consist primarily of landfill capping, closure and post-closure costs, asbestos abatement costs,
demolition and removal costs and leasehold remediation costs. we are legally required to perform capping and closure and post-closure care on the landfills and asbestos abatement on certain of our
premises. for each asset retirement obligation we recognized the estimated fair value of a liability and capitalized the cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset.

direct and subsidiary debt  

huntsman corporation's direct debt and guarantee obligations consist of a guarantee of certain indebtedness incurred from time to time
to finance certain insurance premiums. substantially all of our other debt, including the facilities described below, has been incurred by our subsidiaries (primarily huntsman international); huntsman
corporation is not a guarantor of such subsidiary debt. 


certain
of our subsidiaries are designated as nonguarantor subsidiaries and have third-party debt agreements. these debt agreements contain certain restrictions with regard to
dividends, distributions, loans or advances. in certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to us. 







debt issuance costs  

we record debt issuance costs related to a debt liabillty on the balance sheet as a reduction in the face amount of that debt
liability. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of debt issuance costs directly reducing the debt liability was $67 million and $79 million, respectively. we record the
amortization of debt issuance costs as interest expense. 







senior credit facilities  

as of december 31, 2015, our senior credit facilities consisted of our revolving facility, our extended term loan b facility
("extended term loan b"), our extended term loan b facility—series 2 ("extended term loan b—series 2"), our 2015 extended term loan b facility ("2015 extended

(1)we
had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility; we had approximately $15 million (u.s. dollar equivalents) of letters of credit and
bank guarantees issued and outstanding under our revolving facility.
(2)the
2014 new term loan is subject to a 0.75% libor floor.
(3)the
applicable interest rate of the senior credit facilities is subject to certain secured leverage ratio thresholds. as of december 31, 2015, the
weighted average interest rate on our outstanding balances under the senior credit facilities was approximately 3%.  
 
our
obligations under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by our guarantors, and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic property, plant and
equipment, the stock of all of our material domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries, and pledges of intercompany notes between certain of our subsidiaries. 







amendment to the credit agreement  

on august 10, 2015 we entered into a fourteenth amendment to the agreement governing the senior credit facilities (the "credit
agreement"). the amendment extends the stated maturity date of $773 million aggregate principal amount of our extended term loan b and extended term loan b—series 2 from
april 19, 2017 to april 19, 2019 and increases the interest rate margin with respect to the 2015 extended term loan b to libor plus 3.00% 


on
october 1, 2014, the 2014 new term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion was used to fund the rockwood acquisition. see "note 3. business
combinations and dispositions—rockwood acquisition." the 2014 new term loan matures on october 1, 2021 and has amoritzed in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1% of the original
principal amount of the 2014 new term loan, payable quarterly as of march 31, 2015. the 2014 new term loan bears interest at an interest rate margin of libor plus 3.00% (subject to a 0.75%
floor). 

on
october 1, 2014, huntsman international entered into a further amendment to the credit agreement. the amendment increased revolving commitments in an aggregate principal
amount of $25 million to an aggregate amount of $625 million.

variable interest entity debt  

as of december 31, 2015, arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, had $143 million outstanding
under its loan commitments and debt financing arrangements. on april 29, 2015, arabian amines company obtained a waiver of certain financial covenants from the lender as well as a waiver of
prior noncompliance under the debt financing agreements. as of december 31, 2015, arabian amines company is in compliance with its debt financing arrangements and we have classified
$11 million as current debt and $132 million as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. we do not guarantee these loan commitments, and arabian amines company is not a
guarantor of any of our other debt obligations. 







other debt  

on july 24, 2015, hps entered into a financing arrangement to fund the construction of our mdi plant in china. as part of the
financing, hps has secured commitments of a rmb 669 million (approximately $103 million) term loan and a rmb 423 million (approximately $65 million) working capital
facility. these facilities are unsecured, and we do not provide a guarantee of these loan commitments. as of december 31, 2015 we had nil borrowed on these facilities.

table of contents







note payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation  

as of december 31, 2015, we have a loan of $797 million to our subsidiary, huntsman international. the intercompany note
is unsecured and $100 million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december 31, 2015 on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2015, under the
terms of the intercompany note, huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly average borrowing rate obtained
under our u.s. a/r program, less 10 basis points (provided that the
rate shall not exceed an amount that is 25 basis points less than the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the u.s. libor-based borrowings under our revolving facility). 







compliance with covenants  

we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including
our senior credit facilities, our a/r programs and our notes. 

our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable. furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a
failure to comply with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement. 

our
senior credit facilities are the leverage covenant which applies only to the revolving facility and is calculated at the huntsman international level. the leverage covenant is
applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding). the
leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international's ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda (as defined in the applicable agreement) is not
more than 3.75 to 1. 

if
in the future huntsman international fails to comply with the leverage covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility. if huntsman international
failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility, huntsman international would be in default under
the senior credit facilities, and, unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), huntsman international could
be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities. 

the
agreements governing our a/r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. any material failure to meet the applicable a/r programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the a/r programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the a/r programs in full. an early termination event under the a/r programs
would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our
senior credit facilities.

15. derivative instruments and hedging activities  

we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. from time to time, we
enter into transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations. changes in the
fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 







interest rate risks  

through our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio,
including the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as well as
entering into interest rate derivative instruments. 


from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate long-term debt. under
interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount. 

huntsman
international has entered into several interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our
senior credit facilities. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income
(dollars in millions):

beginning
in 2009, arabian amines company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed payment of
5.02%. in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable
interest entities." the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2015 was $24 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. as of
december 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the swap was $2 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded as other current liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheets. for 2015 and 2014, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of $1 million and $1 million, respectively, due to changes in fair value of the swap. 

for
the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) associated with these cash flow hedging activities were gains of
approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. 


during
2016, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 







foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in
various currencies. we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency
cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions,
principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would
eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $176 million and $179 million notional
amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding, respectively, in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed u.s. dollar payments of $5 million semiannually on may 15 and november 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately €3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). as of december 31, 2015 the fair value of this swap was $28 million and
was recorded in noncurrent assets. 

f-49




 

table of contents

on
march 17, 2010, we entered into three five year cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional $350 million for an aggregate notional
€255 million. this swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. as of december 31, 2014, the fair value of this swap was
$43 million, and was recorded in current assets. during the three months ended march 31, 2015, we terminated these cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $66 million
in payments from the counterparties. 

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2015, we have designated
approximately €751 million (approximately $821 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. for the
years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amount of gain (loss) recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $68 million, $97 million and $(22) million, respectively,
and was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately €1,213 million (approximately $1,325 million) in net euro
assets. 







commodity prices risk  

inherent in our business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. however, our exposure to changing commodity prices is
somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices, and sales prices for many
of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we do not generally hedge our commodity
exposures.

the
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. the fair values of non-qualified employee benefit plan investments and investments in equity securities are obtained through market observable pricing using
prevailing market prices. the estimated fair values of our long-term debt are based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market (level 1). 

the
fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. although management is not aware of any
factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since december 31, 2015,
and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 

the
following assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in millions):

(1)as
of april 1, 2015, we no longer exercise significant influence in our investment in nippon aqua co., ltd., for which we previously
accounted using the equity method. consequently, we now account for this investment at fair value as an available-for-sale equity security.

(2)the
income approach is used to calculate the fair value of these instruments. fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows,
calculated using relevant interest rates, exchange rates, and yield curves at stated intervals. there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine the fair value
during the current period.
in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract.
these instruments have been categorized by us as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs associated with the credit valuation adjustment, which we deemed to be
significant inputs to the overall measurement of fair value at inception.

income approach is used to calculate the fair value of these instruments. fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows,

we
also have assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets include property, plant and equipment and those
associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill and intangible assets. for these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if one or
more is determined to be impaired. during 2015 and 2014, we recorded charges of $19 million and $26 million, respectively, for the impairment of long-lived assets. see "note 11.
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs." 







17. employee benefit plans  







defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans  


our employees participate in a trusteed, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the "plan") that covers substantially all of
our full-time u.s. employees. effective july 1, 2004, the plan formula for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement was converted to a cash balance design. for represented
employees, participation in the cash balance design is subject to the terms of negotiated contracts. for participating employees, benefits accrued under the prior formula were converted to opening
cash balance accounts. the new cash balance benefit formula provides 

f-53




 

table of contents

annual
pay credits from 4% to 12% of eligible pay, depending on age and service, plus accrued interest. participants in the plan on july 1, 2004 may be eligible for additional annual pay
credits from 1% to 8%, depending on their age and service as of that date, for up to five years. the conversion to the cash balance plan did not have a significant impact on the accrued benefit
liability, the funded status or ongoing pension expense. 


we
sponsor defined benefit plans in a number of countries outside of the u.s. the availability of these plans, and their specific design provisions, are consistent with local
competitive practices and regulations. 

we
also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, which provide medical and life insurance benefits. 

our
postretirement benefit plans provide a fully insured medicare part d plan including prescription drug benefits affected by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (the "act"). we cannot determine whether the medical benefits provided by our postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to those provided by the act. we do not
collect a subsidy and our net periodic postretirement benefits cost, and related benefit obligation, do not reflect an amount associated with the subsidy. 

beginning
july 1, 2014, the huntsman defined benefit pension plan was closed to new non-union entrants and as of april 1, 2015, it was closed to new union entrants. in
addition, as of january 1, 2015, rubicon llc also closed its defined benefit plan to new entrants. following the closure of these plans, new hires have been provided with a defined
contribution plan with a non-discretionary employer contribution of 6% of pay and a company match of up to 4% of pay, for a total company contribution of up to 10% of pay. 

in
connection with the rockwood acquisition, we assumed certain pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the amount of approximately $233 million as of
october 1, 2014.

at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the health care trend rate used to measure the expected increase in the cost of benefits was assumed to be 7.0%
and 6.5%,
respectively, decreasing to 5% after 2024. assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. a one-percent point change
in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (dollars in millions):

our
investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to pursue an investment plan that, over the long term, is expected to protect the funded status of the plan, enhance the real
purchasing power of plan assets, and not threaten the plan's ability to meet currently committed obligations. additionally, our investment strategy is to achieve returns on plan assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk. plan assets are invested in a broad range of investments. these investments are diversified in terms of domestic and international equities, both growth and value
funds, including small, mid and large capitalization equities; short-term and long-term debt securities; real estate; and cash and cash equivalents. the investments are further diversified within each
asset category. the portfolio diversification provides protection against a single investment or asset category having a disproportionate impact on the aggregate performance of the plan assets. 


our
pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers. the investment managers value our plan assets using quoted market prices, other observable inputs or unobservable
inputs. for certain assets, the investment managers obtain third-party appraisals at least annually, which use valuation techniques and inputs specific to the applicable property, market, or
geographic location. during 2015, there were no transfers into or out of level 3 assets. 

we
have established target allocations for each asset category. our pension plan assets are periodically rebalanced based upon our target allocations. 


the
fair value of plan assets for the pension plans was $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the following plan assets are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in millions):

equity
securities in our pension plans did not include any direct investments in equity securities of our company or our affiliates at the end of 2015. 







defined contribution
plans—u.s.  

we have a money purchase pension plan covering substantially all of our domestic employees who were hired prior to january 1,
2004. employer contributions are made based on a percentage of employees' earnings (ranging up to 8%). during 2014, we closed this plan to non-union participants, continuing to provide equivalent
benefits to those covered under this plan into their salary deferral account. 

we
also have a salary deferral plan covering substantially all u.s. employees. plan participants may elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their
compensation. we contribute an amount equal to one-half of the participant's contribution, not to exceed 2% of the participant's compensation. 

along
with the introduction of the cash balance formula within our defined benefit pension plan, the money purchase pension plan was closed to new hires. at the same time, our match in
the salary deferral plan was increased, for new hires, to a 100% match, not to exceed 4% of the participant's compensation, once the participant has achieved six years of service with our company. 


our
total combined expense for the above defined contribution plans for each of the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $23 million, $15 million and
$14 million, respectively. 







defined contribution
plans—non-u.s.  

we have defined contribution plans in a variety of non-u.s. locations. 


our
total combined expense for these defined contribution plans for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $13 million, $14 million and
$14 million, respectively, primarily related to the huntsman uk pension plan.

table of contents


all
uk associates are eligible to participate in the huntsman uk pension plan, a contract-based arrangement with a third party. company contributions vary by business during a five year
transition period. plan participants elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their compensation. we contribute a matching amount not to exceed 12% of the
participant's salary for new hires and 15% of the participant's salary for all other participants. 







supplemental salary deferral plan and supplemental executive
retirement plan  

the huntsman supplemental savings plan ("huntsman ssp") is a non-qualified plan covering key management employees and allows
participants to defer amounts that would otherwise be paid as compensation. the participant can defer up to 75% of their salary and bonus each year. this plan also provides benefits that would be
provided under the huntsman salary deferral plan if that plan were not subject to legal limits on the amount of contributions that can be allocated to an individual in a single year. the huntsman ssp
was amended and restated effective as of january 1, 2005 to allow eligible executive employees to comply with section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986. 


the
serp is an unfunded non-qualified pension plan established to provide certain executive employees with benefits that could not be provided, due to legal limitations, under the
huntsman defined benefit pension plan, a qualified defined benefit pension plan, and the huntsman money purchase pension plan, a qualified money purchase pension plan. 

assets
of these plans are included in other noncurrent assets and as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 were $26 million and $24 million, respectively. during each of
the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we expensed a total of $1 million as contributions to the huntsman ssp and the serp. 







stock-based incentive plan  

in connection with the initial public offering of common and preferred stock on february 16, 2005, we adopted the huntsman
stock incentive plan (the "stock incentive plan"). the stock incentive plan permits the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, nonvested stock,
phantom stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock options
may be granted solely to employees. as of december 31, 2015 we are authorized to grant up to 37.2 million shares under the stock incentive plan. see "note 22. stock-based
compensation plan." 







international plans  

international employees are covered by various post-employment arrangements consistent with local practices and regulations. such
obligations are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

during
2013, we declared a dividend from our non-u.s. operations to the u.s., which included bringing onshore certain u.s. foreign tax credits. the foreign tax credits brought onshore
significantly exceeded the amount needed to offset the cash tax impact of the dividend. a full valuation allowance was placed on the remaining foreign tax credits since it was more likely than not
that the credits would expire unused due to the application of specific foreign tax credit limitations. in early 2014, the amount of foreign tax credits brought onshore was adjusted downward by
$10 million, to $104 million, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance. 

after
extensive research and analysis, in september 2014, we made certain elections and filed amended u.s. tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2012, along with our original u.s. tax
return for tax year 2013. these new tax elections and amended tax returns allowed us to utilize u.s. foreign tax credits. the net result was $104 million of income tax benefit recognized during
2014 for the release of the associated valuation allowance, including a discrete income tax benefit of $94 million in the third quarter of 2014. 

during
2015, we declared a dividend from our non-u.s. operations to the u.s. which included bringing onshore certain u.s. foreign tax credits. the foreign tax credits brought onshore
exceeded the amount needed to offset the cash tax impact of the dividend, as well as enough to allow us to carry $14 million of foreign tax credits back to a prior year and claim a refund. 

included
in the non-u.s. deferred tax expense are income tax benefits of $3 million in 2015, $7 million in 2014 and $22 million in 2013 for losses from continuing
operations for certain jurisdictions with valuation allowances to the extent that income was recorded in other comprehensive income in that same jurisdiction. the benefits in 2015 and 2014 were
largely attributable to the u.k and the benefit in 2013 was largely attributable to switzerland. in both years, foreign currency gains and changes in pension related items resulted in income in other
comprehensive income where we have a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset. an offsetting income tax expense was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

we
operate in over 40 non-u.s. tax jurisdictions with no specific country earning a predominant amount of our off-shore earnings. the vast majority of these countries have income tax
rates that are lower than the u.s. statutory rate. the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax losses was lower than the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax income, resulting
in a net expense as compared to the u.s. statutory rate. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the tax rate differential resulted in higher tax expense of $4 million, reflected in the
reconciliation above. 

in
certain non-u.s. tax jurisdictions, our u.s. gaap functional currency is different than the local tax currency. as a result, foreign exchange gains and losses will impact our
effective tax rate. for 2015, this resulted in a $33 million tax benefit ($58 million, net of $25 million of contingent liabilities and valuation allowances). during 2015, a
number of our intercompany liabilities that were denominated in u.s. dollars were owed by entities whose tax currency was the euro. as a result of the depreciation in the euro opposite the u.s.
dollar, these entities recorded a tax only foreign exchange loss. most of the intercompany receivables associated with these same u.s. dollar denominated intercompany debts were held by entities with
a tax currency of the u.s. dollar which, therefore, resulted in no taxable gain.

during 2015, we were granted an extension of a tax holiday from 2015 to 2022 on certain of our manufacturing operations in singapore. during 2015,
pursuant to
the singapore tax holiday, we recorded a benefit of $6 million. we will continue to enjoy this benefit to the extent of continuing profits in this manufacturing endeavor. 


we
calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities related to u.s. state income taxes based on projected apportionment factors. during 2015, we experienced a decrease in our projected
apportionment factors, which decreased our deferred tax liability for u.s. state income taxes. the amount of our deferred tax liability for u.s. state income taxes is significant, and therefore, the
change in apportionment factors for 2015 decreased our net deferred tax liabilities by $5 million. also during 2015, we changed the legal entity location of certain of our u.s. operations.
these changes had the effect of reducing our state tax expense by approximately $3 million. 

the
components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows (dollars in millions):

we
have gross nols of $3,347 million in various non-u.s. jurisdictions. while the majority of the non-u.s. nols have no expiration date, $852 million have a limited life
(of which $489 million are subject to a valuation allowance) and $29 million are scheduled to expire in 2016 (all of which are subject to a valuation allowance). we had no nols expire
unused in 2015. 

included
in the $3,347 million of gross non-u.s. nols is $919 million attributable to our luxembourg entities. as of december 31, 2015, due to the uncertainty
surrounding the realization of the benefits of these losses, there is a valuation allowance of $216 million against these net tax-effected nols of $265 million. 

we
evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by
jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. these conclusions
require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable
period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. our judgments regarding valuation allowances are
also influenced by the costs and risks associated with any tax planning idea.

table of contents


during
2015, we established valuation allowances of $35 million and released valuation allowances of $3 million. in the u.s., we established $14 million of
valuation allowance on u.s. foreign tax credits due to the application of specific foreign tax credit limitations, in the netherlands we established $7 million of valuation allowance on losses
which are scheduled to expire after 2016, and in italy we established $12 million of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets as a result of cumulative losses. 

during
2014, we released valuation allowances of $111 million and established valuation allowances of $3 million. in the u.s., we released $94 million of valuation
allowance on u.s. foreign tax credits as a result of making certain tax elections and filing amended u.s. tax returns and in luxembourg we released a valuation allowance on $6 million of
certain net deferred tax assets as a result of significant changes in estimated future taxable income resulting from increased intercompany receivables and, therefore, increased interest income in
luxembourg, our primary treasury center outside of the u.s. 

during
2013, we established valuation allowances of $95 million primarily on u.s. foreign tax credits as a result of insufficient foreign source income and we released valuation
allowances on $16 million of certain net deferred tax assets as a result of significant changes in estimated future taxable income resulting from increased intercompany receivables and,
therefore, increased interest income. 

uncertainties
regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions and result in additional valuation
allowances in future periods, or, in the case of unexpected pre-tax earnings, the release of valuation allowances in future periods.

following is a summary of changes in the valuation allowance (dollars in millions):

as
of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $50 million and $36 million,
respectively. 

during
2015, 2014, and 2013, for unrecognized tax benefits that impact tax expense, we recorded a net increase in unrecognized tax benefits with a corresponding income tax expense (not
including interest and penalty expense) of $19 million, $1 million and $8 million, respectively. additional decreases in unrecognized tax benefits were offset by cash settlements
or by a decrease in net deferred tax assets and, therefore, did not affect income tax expense. 

in
accordance with our accounting policy, we continue to recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

we
conduct business globally and, as a result, we file income tax returns in u.s. federal, various u.s. state and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the following table summarizes the tax
years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions:

certain
of our u.s. and non-u.s. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities and the amounts ultimately agreed upon in resolution of the
issues raised may differ materially from the amounts accrued. 

we
estimate that it is reasonably possible that certain of our non-u.s. unrecognized tax benefits could change within 12 months of the reporting date with a resulting decrease in
the unrecognized tax benefits within a reasonably possible range of $4 million to $24 million. for the 12-month period from the reporting date, we would expect that a substantial portion
of the decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits would result in a corresponding benefit to our income tax expense. 

during
2015, we concluded and effectively settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to china
and france. during 2014, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, china, france and
spain. during 2013, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, china, france and italy. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that are reinvested
and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. we have material intercompany debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation and our ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of intercompany debt owned by our
non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend, we expect to utilize our intercompany debt. if any earnings
were repatriated via dividend, we may need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. 

as
discussed, we made a distribution of a portion of our earnings in 2015 and 2013 when the amount of foreign tax credits associated with the distribution was greater than the amount of
tax otherwise due. the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries with positive earnings that are

deemed
to be permanently invested were approximately $354 million at december 31, 2015. it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings
because of the significant assumptions necessary to compute the tax. 








19. commitments and contingencies  







purchase commitments  

we have various purchase commitments extending through 2029 for materials, supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course
of business. included in the purchase commitments table below are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2016.
certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period,
such notice period has been included in the table below. the contractual purchase prices for substantially all of these contracts are variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations.
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume
is purchased. we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made minimum payments of nil,
nil and $7 million, respectively, under such take or pay contracts without taking the product.

operating leases  

we lease certain railcars, aircraft, equipment and facilities under long-term lease agreements. the total expense recorded under
operating lease agreements in our consolidated statements of operations is approximately $94 million, $97 million and $80 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, net of
sublease rentals of approximately $3 million, $3 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

legal matters  







antitrust matters  

we were named as a defendant in consolidated class action civil antitrust suits filed on february 9 and 12, 2010 in the u.s.
district court for the district of maryland alleging that we and our co-defendants and other alleged co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the u.s. between at least
march 1, 2002 and the present. the other defendants named in this matter were dupont, kronos and cristal (formerly millennium). on august 28, 2012, the court certified a class consisting
of all u.s. customers who purchased titanium dioxide directly from the defendants (the "direct purchasers") since february 1, 2003. on december 13, 2013, we and all other defendants
settled the direct purchasers litigation and the court approved the settlement. we paid the settlement in an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. 

on
november 22, 2013, we were named as a defendant in a civil antitrust suit filed in the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota brought by a direct purchaser who
opted out of the direct purchasers class litigation (the "opt-out litigation"). on april 21, 2014, the court severed the claims against us from the other defendants sued and ordered our case
transferred to the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas. subsequently, kronos, another defendant, was also severed from the minnesota case and claims against it were transferred and
consolidated for trial with our case in the southern district of texas. the trial previously scheduled to begin february 22, 2016 has been rescheduled to begin september 26, 2016. it is
possible that additional claims will be filed by other direct purchasers who opted out of the class litigation. 

we
were also named as a defendant in a class action civil antitrust suit filed on march 15, 2013 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california by the
purchasers of products made from titanium dioxide (the "indirect purchasers") making essentially the same allegations as did the direct
purchasers. on october 14, 2014, plaintiffs filed their second amended class action complaint narrowing the class of plaintiffs to those merchants and consumers of architectural coatings
containing titanium dioxide. on august 11, 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss the indirect purchasers litigation with leave to amend the complaint. a third amended class action
complaint was filed on september 29, 2015 further limiting the class to consumers of architectural paints. plaintiffs have raised state antitrust claims under the laws of 15 states, consumer
protection claims under the laws of 9 states, and unjust enrichment claims under the laws of 16 states. on november 4, 2015, we and our co-defendants filed another motion to dismiss, which
remains pending. the opt-out litigation and

indirect
purchasers plaintiffs seek to recover injunctive relief, treble damages or the maximum damages allowed by state law, costs of suit and attorneys' fees. we are not aware of any illegal conduct
by us or any of our employees. nevertheless, we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts which in the aggregate could be material to us. because of the
overall complexity of these cases, we are unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss associated with these claims and we have made no accruals with respect to these claims. 







product delivery claim  

we have been notified by a customer of potential claims related to our alleged delivery of a different product than the one the
customer had ordered. our customer claims that it was unaware that the different product had been delivered until after that product had been used to manufacture materials which were subsequently
sold. originally, the customer stated that it had been notified of claims by its customers of up to an aggregate of €153 million (approximately $167 million) relating to
this matter and claimed that we may be responsible for all or a portion of these potential claims. our customer has since resolved some of these claims and the aggregate amount of the current claims
is now approximately €113 million (approximately $123 million). based on the facts currently available, we believe that we are insured for any liability we may ultimately
have in excess of $10 million. however, no assurance can be given regarding our ultimate liability or costs. we believe our range of possible loss in this matter is between €0
and €113 million (approximately $123 million), and we have made no accrual with respect to this matter. 







indemnification matters  

on july 3, 2012, deutsche bank securities inc. and credit suisse securities (usa) llc ("the banks") demanded that
we indemnify them for claims brought against them by certain matlinpatterson entities that were formerly our stockholders ("matlinpatterson") in litigation filed by matlinpatterson on june 19,
2012 in the 9th district court in montgomery county, texas (the "texas litigation"). the banks assert that they are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the agreement of compromise and
settlement between the banks and our company, dated june 22, 2009, wherein the banks and our company settled claims that we filed relating to the failed acquisition by and merger with hexion.
matlinpatterson claims that the banks knowingly made materially false representations about the nature of the financing for the acquisition of our company by hexion and that they suffered substantial
loss in value to their 19 million shares of our common stock as a result thereof. matlinpatterson is asserting statutory fraud, common law fraud and aiding and abetting statutory fraud and are
seeking actual damages, exemplary damages, costs and attorney's fees and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. on december 21, 2012, the court dismissed the texas litigation, a decision
which was affirmed by the ninth court of appeals of texas on may 15, 2014. a subsequent motion for rehearing by matlinpatterson was denied by the same appellate court on june 12, 2014. a
petition for discretionary review in the texas supreme court was denied by final order entered january 7, 2016. 


on
july 14, 2014, the banks demanded that we indemnify them for additional claims brought against them by certain other former company stockholders in litigation filed
june 14, 2014 in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin (the "wisconsin litigation"). the stockholders in the wisconsin litigation have made essentially the same
allegations as matlinpatterson made in the texas litigation and, additionally, have named apollo global management llc and apollo management holdings, l.p. as defendants. stockholder
plaintiffs in the wisconsin litigation assert claims for misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud. on april 9, 2015, the court denied the banks' motions to dismiss the wisconsin litigation,
which were on the same grounds asserted in the texas litigation, as moot. we expect the banks to refile these motions once limited discovery related to jurisdiction is complete. we denied the banks'
indemnification demand for both the texas litigation and the wisconsin litigation.

other proceedings  

we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under
provisions of applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these
matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 







20. environmental, health and safety matters  







ehs capital expenditures  

we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and
repair pollution control equipment. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled $141 million, $125 million, and
$92 million, respectively. because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of
specific requirements, our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future
amounts we may spend related to ehs and other applicable laws. 







environmental reserves  

we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known
penalties. liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimates are calculated using present value
techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. the environmental liabilities do not include amounts
recorded as asset retirement obligations. we had accrued $38 million and $60 million for environmental liabilities as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. of these
amounts, $6 million and $7 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $32 million
and $53 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in certain cases, our remediation
liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or
range of such potential excess. 







environmental matters  

under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") and similar state laws, a current or former
owner or operator of real property in the u.s. may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it
occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. outside the u.s., analogous contaminated property laws, such
as those in effect in france and australia, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. currently, there are approximately 10 former facilities or third-party
sites in the u.s. for which we have been notified of potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed under cercla. based on current information and
past experiences at other cercla sites, we do not expect these third-party claims to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

under
the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") in the u.s. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a
condition to our hazardous waste permit. some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. we are aware of soil,
groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. for example, our port neches, texas, and geismar, louisiana,
facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements imposed under rcra. similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing
facilities, such as australia, india, france, hungary and italy. 







west footscray remediation  

by letter dated march 7, 2006, our former base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray, australia was issued a
cleanup notice by the environmental protection authority victoria ("epa victoria") due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. on august 23, 2010, epa
victoria revoked a second cleanup notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation. as of december 31, 2015, we had an accrued
liability of approximately $17 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site. we can provide no assurance that the authority will not
seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be required for the cleanup. 







north maybe mine remediation  

the north maybe canyon mine site is a cercla site and involves a former phosphorous mine near soda springs, idaho, which is believed
to have been operated by several companies, including a predecessor company to us. in 2004, the u.s. forest service notified us that we are a cercla prp for contamination originating from the site. in
february 2010, we and wells cargo (another prp) agreed to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study of a portion of the site and are currently engaged in that process. at this time, we
are unable to reasonably estimate our potential liabilities at this site. 







port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the u.s.
department of justice (the "doj") notified us that we were in violation of the caa based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the enforcement
initiative to bring similar actions against refiners and other chemical manufacturers and has sought to collect civil penalties in excess of $100,000. specifically, the epa alleged violations at our
port neches, texas facility from 2007-2012 for flare operations not consistent with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these
findings, the epa referred this matter to the doj. we provided a formal response to the doj and the epa with a supplemental data submission on april 29, 2013. we have been engaged in
discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these alleged violations and conducted field trials on an alternate flare monitoring method beginning in september 2014. we are currently unable
to determine the likelihood or magnitude of any potential penalty or injunctive relief that may be incurred in resolving this matter.

21. huntsman corporation stockholders' equity  







share repurchase program  

on september 29, 2015, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our
common stock. repurchases under this program may be made through open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or by other means. the timing and
actual number of any shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including market conditions. the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and repurchases may be
commenced, suspended or discontinued from time to time without prior notice. on october 27, 2015, we entered into and funded an accelerated share repurchase agreement with citibank, n.a. to
repurchase $100 million of our common stock. citibank, n.a. made an initial delivery of approximately 7.1 million shares of huntsman corporation common stock based on the closing price
of $11.94 on october 27, 2015. the accelerated share repurchase agreement was completed in january 2016 with the delivery of an additional approximately 1.5 million shares of
huntsman corporation common stock. the final number of shares repurchased and the aggregate cost per share was based on the company's daily volume-weighted average stock price during the term of the
transaction, less a discount.

22. stock-based compensation plan  

under the stock incentive plan, a plan approved by stockholders, we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our
subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock options may be granted solely to employees. the terms of the grants are fixed at the grant date. as of december 31, 2015 we were authorized to grant
up to 37.2 million shares under the stock incentive plan. as of december 31, 2015, we had 7 million shares remaining under the stock incentive plan available for grant. option
awards have a maximum contractual term of 10 years and generally must have an exercise price at least

total income tax benefit recognized in the statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements was $6 million, $6 million and $7 million for the
years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 







stock options  

the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model that uses the
assumptions noted in the following table. expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock through the grant date. the expected term of options granted was estimated
based on the contractual term of the instruments and employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the
option was based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the assumptions noted below represent the weighted averages of the assumptions utilized for all stock options granted
during the year.

the
weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $9.81, $9.63 and $7.93 per option, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, there
was $11 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option arrangements granted under the stock incentive plan. that cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years. 

during
the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was approximately nil, $14 million and $14 million,
respectively. 







nonvested shares  

nonvested shares granted under the stock incentive plan consist of restricted stock, which is accounted for as an equity award, and
phantom stock, which is accounted for as a liability award because it can be settled in either stock or cash. 

during
the first quarter of 2015, we began issuing performance awards to certain employees. the fair value of each performance award is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model
that uses various assumptions, including an expected volatility rate and a risk-free interest rate. for the year ended december 31, 2015 the weighted-average expected volatility rate was 30.0%
and the weighted average risk-free interest rate was 0.7%. for the performance awards granted during the year ended december 31, 2015, the number of shares earned varies based upon the company
achieving certain performance criteria over two-year and three-year performance periods. the performance criteria are total stockholder return of our common stock relative to the total stockholder
return of a specified industry peer-group for the two-year and three-year performance periods.

(1)as
of december 31, 2015, a total of 393,952 restricted stock units were vested but not yet issued, of which 29,645 vested during 2015. these shares
have not been reflected as vested shares in this table because, in accordance with the restricted stock unit agreements, shares of common stock are not issued for vested restricted stock units until
termination of employment. this table does reflect 29,921 vested restricted stock units for which shares of common stock were issued in 2015.  
 
as
of december 31, 2015, there was $20 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share compensation arrangements granted under the stock
incentive plan. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years. the value of share awards that vested during the years ended
december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $20 million, $19 million and $18 million, respectively.

our
subsidiary airstar corporation ("airstar") subleases a gulfstream iv-sp aircraft (the "aircraft") from jstar corporation ("jstar"), a corporation wholly owned by jon m.
huntsman pursuant to a lease arrangement that expires in 2021. jon m. huntsman is the executive chairman and the father of our chief executive officer, peter r. huntsman and our division
president, advanced materials, james h. huntsman. under this arrangement, monthly sublease payments from airstar to jstar are approximately $120,000, and an aggregate of $8 million is
payable through the end of the remaining six year lease term. these monthly sublease payments are equal to the financing costs paid by jstar to a leasing company and the arrangement does not result in
a financial benefit to jstar. 

we
occupy and use a portion of an office building owned by the huntsman foundation, a private charitable foundation established by jon m. and karen h. huntsman to further
the charitable interests of the huntsman family, under a lease pursuant to which we make annual lease payments of approximately $2 million. during each of the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013,
we made payments of approximately $2 million to the huntsman foundation under the lease. the lease expires on december 31, 2018, subject to a five-year extension, at our option.

may 2002, we paid the premiums on various life insurance policies for jon m. huntsman. these policies have been liquidated, and the cash values have been paid to
mr. huntsman. mr. huntsman is indebted to us in the amount of approximately $2 million with accrued interest, which represents the
insurance premiums paid on his behalf through may 2002. this amount is included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

effective
august 31, 2015, we entered into a new consulting agreement with jon m. huntsman, jr., one of our former directors and the former governor of utah and u.s. ambassador
to singapore and china. pursuant to the new consulting agreement, jon m. huntsman, jr. agreed to: provide strategic advice to senior management and the board of the company on political, economic and
business matters; support development and continued maintenance of the company's high value customers and significant business relationships across all regions; support development and continued
maintenance of governmental and business relationships in developing economic regions, particularly in connection with markets and opportunities in india, china and southeast asia; participate in
negotiations and discussions with business executives and leaders, government officials and/or dignitaries; and participate in such other meetings or discussions as may be requested by senior
management of the company upon reasonable notice. in exchange for these services, we agree to pay jon m. huntsman, jr. $50,000 per month through the term of the consulting
agreement and up to $200,000 in additional compensation based on achievement of designated results as determined by the board. the new consulting agreement expires on august 31, 2016, subject
to our right to extend the agreement for one year terms. jon m. huntsman, jr. is the son of our executive chairman, jon m. huntsman and the brother of our chief executive officer,

(1)during
the three months ended december 31, 2015, we declared a dividend from our non-u.s. operations to the u.s., which included bringing onshore
certain u.s. foreign tax credits. the foreign tax credits brought onshore exceeded the amount needed to offset the cash tax impact of the dividend, as well as enough to allow us to carry
$14 million of foreign tax credits back to a prior year and claim a refund. during 2015, a number of our intercompany liabilities that were denominated in u.s. dollars were owed by entities
whose tax currency was the euro. as a result of the depreciation in the euro opposite the u.s. dollar, these entities recorded a tax only foreign exchange loss. most of the intercompany receivables
associated with these same u.s. dollar denominated intercompany debts were held by entities with a tax currency of the u.s. dollar which, therefore, resulted in no taxable gain. this resulted in a
$33 million tax benefit ($58 million, net of $25 million of contingent liabilities and valuation allowances) in the fourth quarter of 2015.
(2)during
the three months ended september 30, 2014, as a result of extensive research and analysis, we filed amended u.s. tax returns for tax years
2008 through 2012, along with our original u.s. tax return for tax year 2013, and made elections which allowed us to utilize u.s. foreign tax credits. as a result of utilizing these assets that had
been subject to a valuation allowance, we recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $94 million in the third quarter of 2014.
(3)basic
and diluted income per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during that period. therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share.
