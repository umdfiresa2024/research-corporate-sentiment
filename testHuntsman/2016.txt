item 1.    business        







general  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our company, a delaware
corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the businesses of huntsman holdings, llc, a company founded by jon m. huntsman. mr. huntsman founded the predecessor to our company in 1970 as a
small polystyrene plastics packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of significant acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 

we
operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999. 

our
principal executive offices are located at 10003 woodloch forest drive, the woodlands, texas 77380, and our telephone number at that location is (281) 719-6000. 








recent developments  

on january 30, 2017, our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in pori, finland experienced fire damage and is currently not
operational. the fire brigade responded quickly to extinguish the fire and there were no injuries. we have notified applicable customers and suppliers of this force
majeure event. we do not currently have an estimated time frame for how long the facility will be off line, but we are committed to repairing the facility as quickly as
possible. the pori facility has a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons, which represents approximately 15% of our total titanium dioxide capacity and approximately 10% of total european titanium
dioxide demand. the site is insured for property damage as well as business interruption losses. according to our insurance policies, the respective retention levels (deductibles) for physical damage
and business interruption are $15 million and 60 days, respectively. on february 9, 2017, we received a €50 million (approximately $52 million)
payment from our insurer as an initial partial progress payment towards the overall pending claim. 

on
october 28, 2016, we filed an initial form 10 registration statement with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") as part of the process to spin off our
pigments and additives and textile effects businesses in a tax-free transaction. on january 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our textile effects business and we amended the
form 10 registration statement. we also announced that the name of the spin-off entity will be venator materials corporation ("venator"). venator shares are expected to trade on the new york
stock exchange under the ticker vntr after the distribution to our stockholders. the completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of
conditions, including the registration statement on form 10 for venator's common stock being declared effective by the sec and certain other conditions described in the information statement
included in the form 10. the ongoing process to separate the pigments and additives business is proceeding and is targeted for the second quarter 2017. as noted above, there was fire damage
sustained at our titanium dioxide facility in pori, finland. the potential impact of this interruption, if any, on the spin date is not yet known. 


on
december 30, 2016, our performance products segment completed the sale of its european surfactants business to innospec inc. for $199 million in cash plus our
retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. under the terms of the transaction, innospec acquired our manufacturing facilities located in saint-mihiel,
france; castiglione delle stiviere, italy; and barcelona, spain. the purchase price is subject to the finalization of working capital adjustments. we remain committed to our global surfactants
business, including in the u.s. and australia, where our differentiated surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks. upon closing the transaction, we entered into supply
and long-term tolling arrangements with innospec in order to continue marketing certain core products strategic to our global agrochemicals, lubes and certain other

businesses.
in connection with this sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $98 million. 


on
december 30, 2016, we made an early repayment of $260 million on our 2015 extended term loan b facility due 2019 ("2015 extended term loan b") using proceeds from the
sale of the european surfactants business and existing cash. 







overview  

we operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our products
comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications,
including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and
coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants,
maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. our administrative, research
and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below, which are located in 29 countries. 


as
of december 31, 2016, we employed approximately 15,000 associates worldwide. our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were
$9,657 million, $10,299 million and $11,578 million, respectively. 







our products  

we produce differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and textile
effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces primarily inorganic chemical products. 


growth
in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. accordingly, the profitability
of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the petrochemical industry. titanium dioxide, within our pigments and additives segment, is
cyclical and influenced by seasonal demand patterns in the coatings industry.

polyurethanes  







general  

we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including mdi products, po, polyols, pg and tpu
(each discussed in more detail below under "—products and markets"). polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and
elastomers. we focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for specialty mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued
substitution of mdi-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. we operate five primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. we also
operate 19 strategically located downstream polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as "systems houses," located in close proximity to our customers
worldwide (see facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below), which enables us to focus on customer support, technical service and a differentiated product offering. we also
operate a specialty polyol manufacturing facility focused on the insulation market and three downstream tpu manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. 


our
customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as mdi, with polyols, which are derived largely from po and eo. we are able to produce over
2,000 distinct mdi-based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations.
as a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from mdi, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and
appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, coatings, adhesives, wood binders for construction and furniture, footwear and other specialized engineering applications. 


we
are one of three north american producers of po. we and some of our customers process po into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, pg and various other
chemical products. end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings
and cleaning products industries. we also produce mtbe as a co-product of our po manufacturing process. mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to
enhance the octane rating of gasoline. see "—item 1a. risk factors." 

in
1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china. we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated
polyurethanes formulation facility and a world scale research and development campus. in january 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near
shanghai, china in caojing. in june 2006, hps, a consolidated joint venture, began production at our mdi finishing plant. in september 2006, slic, an unconsolidated joint venture, began production at
the mnb, aniline and crude mdi plants. we intend to expand the capacity of these facilities by 2018. these world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical
chinese market, the largest mdi market in the world, and will support the long-term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. additionally, in november 2012, we entered
into an agreement with sinopec to
form a joint venture to build a world scale po/mtbe plant in nanjing, china. the facility is expected to be mechanically complete in early 2017 with beneficial commercial operations expected in
the second half of 2017, and will utilize our proprietary po/mtbe manufacturing technology. we own a 49%

interest
in the joint venture and account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment. 







products and markets  

mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives,
sealants and elastomers. polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with mdi in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. po is one of the principal
raw materials for producing polyether polyols. the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. 



  

polyurethane
chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. depending on their needs, customers will use either component polyurethane
chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. by varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are
able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products. 


our
strategy is focused on growing our differentiated product offering (specialty mdi and polyols, formulated mdi systems and tpu), which requires a greater emphasis on formulating
capability to provide our downstream customers with the end effect required in their applications these
differentiated products tend to require technical solutions, offer higher margins, lower volatility and are less dependent on industry utilization rates compared to sales of component mdi or component
polyols. 

mdi.    mdi has grown substantially over the past three decades, increasing by a factor of 6% or 7% cagr, well in excess of global
gdp. mdi has a
substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane isocyanates. this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and
can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. we believe that mdi and formulated mdi systems, which combine mdi and polyols, will continue to grow at approximately double the rate of global
gdp driven by the mega trends of energy management, food preservation, demographics and urbanization/transportation. mdi offers key products benefits of energy efficiency, comfort and durability
aligned with these megatrends. we believe that mdi and formulated mdi systems will continue to substitute for alternative materials such as fiberglass in insulation, phenol formaldehyde in wood
binders and tdi in automotive and furniture.

table of contents

specialty
cushioning and insulation applications, thermoplastic polyurethanes and adhesives and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi. mdi experiences some seasonality in its
sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern
hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 


tpu.    tpu is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with
polyols to produce
unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific
requirements of our customers. tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. it is also extruded into films for apparel, wires and cables for
industrial use and in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets. 


polyols.    polyols are combined with mdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of formulated polyurethane systems.
demand for specialty
polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown. 

aniline.    aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi. the majority of our aniline is consumed
internally with some sold to
third parties. we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing
facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract. 


po.    po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg. demand for po depends largely on
overall economic demand,
especially that of consumer durables. strategically, we use po produced at our world scale po/mtbe facility in port neches, texas, downstream in our formulated mdi systems. we are also currently
constructing a po/mtbe facility in nanjing, china with the strategic aim of supplying po downstream into our china business, accelerating our differentiated growth in the world's largest pu market. in
addition, we also have an important internal strategic outlet for po, downstream into our performance products amines business, which generates significant added value to the po molecule. 


mtbe.    mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of
gasoline. while mtbe
has been effectively eliminated in the united states, demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. see "—item 1a. risk factors." in 2011, we announced the signing of a
license agreement with chinese chemicals manufacturer yantai wanhua polyurethanes co., ltd, for the production of po and mtbe. in november 2012, we entered into an agreement to
form a joint venture with sinopec to construct and operate a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51%
interest. see "—manufacturing and operations" below and "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." 

it
is important to recognize the strategic link between po, polyols and mdi. mtbe is a co-product of the po manufacturing process which generates cash in the gasoline market. our
strategic focus is on growing our differentiated (specialty mdi and polyols, formulated mdi based systems and

sales and marketing  

we market our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,500 customers in more than 90 countries. our sales, marketing and technical resources are
organized to support major regional markets and key end-use markets, some of which requires a coordinated global approach, such as key accounts across the automotive sector. these key end-use markets
include the commercial and residential insulation, appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. we sell both directly and indirectly to
customers, the latter via a network of distributors and agents who in turn sell our products to customers who cannot be served as cost effectively by our internal sales groups. 

we
provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we provide the total isocyanate and
polyol formulation to our customers. our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers' needs is critical to our long-term success. we have
strategically located our downstream polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. we believe this customer support and technical
service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers. 

our
strategy is to grow the number of and capability of our downstream facilities both organically and inorganically. as a result, we have made a number of "bolt-on" acquisitions in
recent years to expand our downstream footprint and align with our strategic intent. 


we
believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have
facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. our sales strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by
providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service.

manufacturing and operations  

our world-scale mdi production facilities are located in geismar, louisiana; rotterdam, the netherlands; and through our joint ventures in
caojing, china. these facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of mdi, from our facilities located in geismar, louisiana; wilton, u.k.; and caojing, china. we
believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities is necessary to provide cost competitiveness in mdi production. the following table sets forth the annual production

(1)represents
our 50% share of capacity from slic.
(2)represents
our approximately 85% share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation. 
 
at
our geismar, rotterdam and caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce mdi. this technology contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer.
in addition to mdi, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po. we own or license all technology and know-how developed and utilized at our po facility. our process combines
isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming tbhp and tba, which are further processed into po and mtbe, respectively. because our po production process is
less expensive relative to other technologies and allows po co-products to be processed into saleable or useable
materials, we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives. 







joint ventures  

rubicon joint venture.    chemtura corporation is our joint venture partner in rubicon llc, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene
and dpa
manufacturing facilities in geismar, louisiana. we are entitled to approximately 85% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc, and chemtura corporation is entitled to
100% of the dpa production. in addition to operating the joint venture's aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa facilities, rubicon llc operates our wholly-owned mdi, polyol and maleic anhydride
facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex. as a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs
for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements.

chinese mdi joint ventures.    we are involved in two related joint ventures which operate mdi production facilities in caojing,
china. slic, our
manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies, produces mnb, aniline and crude mdi. we effectively own 35% of slic and account for our investment under the equity method.
hps, our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd, manufactures pure mdi, polymeric mdi, mdi variants and formulated mdi systems. we own 70% of hps and it is
consolidated in our financial statements. these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. the total production capacity of the
slic facilities is 700 million pounds per year of mdi, of which hps is entitled to 50%, and the splitting capacity of the hps facility is 350 million pounds per year of mdi. 

slic
is in the process of expanding capacity in caojing by 530 million pounds per year of mdi and hps is also expanding splitting capacity. we anticipate that the expansion will
be complete with beneficial commercial operations in the first half of 2018. 


chinese po/mtbe joint venture.    in november 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec. the
joint venture involves
the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51% interest. our total equity
investment is anticipated to be approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. at the end of 2016, cumulative capital contributions were approximately
$85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. mechanical completion of the project is expected in early 2017. we expect beneficial commercial operations during the second half of
2017 as soon as supply for the key raw material isobutane is available. 







raw materials  

the primary raw materials for mdi-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po. benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary
feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline. historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and
aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce mdi. 

a
major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po. the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a
competitively priced, strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products. the primary raw materials used in our po production process are
butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen. 







competition  

our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include basf, covestro, dow, wanhua chemical group and lyondellbasell. while these
competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on mdi and mdi-based formulated polyurethane systems. our polyurethane chemicals business competes in
two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on
technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance, our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and providing customers with innovative
solutions to their needs.

performance products  







general  

our performance products segment has leading global positions in the manufacture and sale of amines, surfactants and maleic anhydride and serves
a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets. our performance products segment is organized by region and product family. our product families are: amines; maleic anhydride (including
catalyst and licensing); surfactants (including lab); and upstream intermediates. 

we
produce a wide range of amines, many of which are sold into specialty markets such as epoxy curing agents, oil exploration and production, agrochemicals, and fuel and lubricant
additives. we believe we are the largest global producer of polyetheramines, one of the largest producers of 2-(2-amino ethoxy) ethanol, sold under our dga® brand, the second largest
producer of ethyleneamines and morpholine and the second largest north american producer of ethanolamines. we are the only producer and largest supplier of propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate
in north america. many of the markets for these products have growth rates in excess of global gdp. 

we
believe we are the largest global producer of maleic anhydride, a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce uprs, which are mainly used in the production of
fiberglass reinforced resins for marine, automotive and construction products. maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. we are also the
leading licensor of maleic anhydride manufacturing technology and the largest supplier of butane fixed bed catalyst used in maleic anhydride manufacturing. 


we
consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, lab and ethanolamines products. we produce a broad range of surfactants,
which are primarily used in detergency, personal care, agrochemical, oilfield and industrial applications. we
manufacture lab for use as an intermediate in laundry detergents and a higher molecular weight alkylate used as a lubricant additive. 

we
also use internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals to produce eg, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers, pet packaging and antifreeze. 


beginning
in 2013, our performance products segment initiated a restructuring program to refocus its surfactants business in europe. in connection with this program, in 2014 we completed
the sale of our european commodity surfactants business, including the ethoxylation facility in lavera, france to wilmar. additionally, in 2014 we ceased production at our patrica, italy surfactants
facility. in december 2015, we announced plans for a reorganization of our commercial and technical functions and a refocused divisional business strategy to better position our segment for growth in
coming years and we launched a program to capture growth opportunities, improve manufacturing cost efficiency and reduce inventories. in 2016, we expanded our eo capacity by 265 million pounds
at our port neches, texas facility. on december 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our european surfactants business to innospec inc. for $199 million in cash plus our retention
of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. we remain committed to our global surfactants business, including in the u.s. and australia, where our differentiated
surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks. 

we
operate 14 performance products manufacturing facilities in north america, europe, the middle east, asia and australia.

the
following chart illustrates the primary raw materials used and range of product types produced by the performance products segment: 



  







products and markets  

amines.    amines are a family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene
derivatives.
generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth.
however, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have historically grown at rates in excess of gdp growth due to new product development, technical innovation and end-use
substitution. as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use applications, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with
movements in underlying raw materials. our amines business is organized around the following product groups: 
 

 
 










product group



 
 
applications 


polyetheramines
 
epoxy composites, polyurethane foams and insulation, construction and flooring, paints and coatings, lubricant and fuel additives, adhesives, agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, printing inks, pigment
dispersion


ethyleneamines
 
chemical building block used in lubricant and fuel additives, epoxy hardeners, wet strength resins, chelating agents, fungicides


ethanolamines
 
wood preservatives, herbicides, construction products, gas treatment, metalworking, personal care


other specialty amines, including dga® agent
 
gas treating, ag chemicals, personal care, lubricant and fuel additives, polyurethane foams, fabric softeners, paints and coatings, refinery processing, water treating



 
polyetheramines
are produced by reacting polyol with ammonia. they provide sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy
formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials. 

12




 

table of contents

our
ethyleneamines are manufactured by reacting edc and caustic soda with ammonia to produce a range of various ethyleneamines homologues having different molecular weights. most other
producers utilize a reductive amination process, which yields a light slate of ethyleneamines. we believe our heavier slate of homologues allows access to a greater range of markets. 


ethanolamines
are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia. there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. 

our
amines are used in a wide variety of mainly industrial applications, including composites, paints and coatings, polyurethane foam, fuel and lubricant additives, and solvents. our key
amines customers include proctor & gamble, chevron, lubrizol, air products, hexion, afton, infineum, univar, monsanto and ppg. 

maleic anhydride (including catalyst and licensing).    maleic anhydride is a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used
to produce uprs, which
are the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. maleic anhydride is also used in the
production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. 
 

 
 










product group



 
 
applications 


maleic anhydride
 
boat hulls, automotive, construction, lubricant and fuel additives, countertops, agrochemicals, paper and food additives


maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing
 
maleic anhydride, bdo and its derivatives, and pbt manufacturers



 
maleic
anhydride is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst. our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed butane process with
solvent. we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock, energy efficiency and solvent recovery. the maleic anhydride-based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred
process technology and is favored over the other routes, which include po, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. as a result, the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our
maleic anhydride technology and catalyst. generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs. 

we
license our maleic anhydride technology and supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers. revenue from licensing and catalyst comes from new plant
commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and catalyst change schedules. our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other performance products businesses and other segments. 

our
key maleic anhydride customers include aoc, reichhold, tate & lyle, afton, ccp composites, cranston, dixie, gulf chemical, lubrizol and mfg chemical. 


surfactants (including lab).    surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water soluble component with a
water insoluble
component in the same molecule. while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating
and wetting properties in a variety of industries. 

we
are a leading global manufacturer of nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactants products and are characterized by our breadth of product offering and market coverage.

demand
growth for surfactants used in basic detergency applications is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. however, many product applications for surfactants can demand
new formulations with improved performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with
differentiated specifications and properties. we continue to strengthen and diversify our surfactant product offering into formulated specialty surfactant products for use in various industrial
applications such as leather and textile treatment, foundry and construction, agrochemicals, fuels and lubricants, personal care and polymers and coatings. 

for
basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. surfactants used in more specialty
applications are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use application. our key surfactants customers include l'oreal,
monsanto, nufarm, clorox, henkel, colgate, procter & gamble and unilever. 

lab
is a surfactant intermediate, which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins. nearly all the lab produced globally is
converted into las, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. we also manufacture a higher-molecular-weight alkylate,
which is used as an additive to lubricants. our key customers for lab and specialty alkylates include colgate, lubrizol, procter & gamble and unilever. 

upstream intermediates.    we consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our
surfactants, lab, and
ethanolamines products, which are primarily used in detergency, consumer products and industrial applications. we also produce eg, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and pet
packaging. 

we
consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg: meg, deg and teg. meg is consumed primarily in the polyester (fiber and bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and
is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. deg is consumed internally for the production of morpholine and
dga® agent and polyols. teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. we continue to optimize our eo and eg operations
depending on the fundamental market demand for eg.

sales and marketing  

we sell over 1,500 products to over 3,000 customers globally through our performance products regional sales and marketing organizations, which
have extensive market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships. 

in
more specialty markets (e.g. energy, materials, additives, processing chemicals and agrochemicals), our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in
certain customer applications. we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our
customers. 

our
intermediate surfactants are sold mainly into the home and personal care market for which we have a dedicated marketing group. we also sell eg directly. 

we
provide extensive pre- and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to
tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. these technical service professionals interact closely with our marketing managers and business leadership teams to
help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. in addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our
products. these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end-use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces. 







manufacturing and operations  

our performance products segment has the capacity to produce more than six billion pounds annually of a wide variety of products and

our
amines facilities are located globally. these facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and
technical innovation. 

almost
all of our surfactants facilities in the u.s. and asia have integrated eo supply, which we believe gives us a competitive cost advantage. 

our
primary ethylene, propylene, eo, eg and ethanolamines facilities are located in port neches, texas alongside our polyurethanes po/mtbe facility. the port neches, texas facility
benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure, which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products. 

a
number of our facilities are located within large integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes. we believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we
would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand-alone operations. these include our lab facility in chocolate bayou, texas; our maleic anhydride facilities in pensacola, florida, geismar,
louisiana and moers, germany and our ethyleneamines facility in freeport, texas. 







joint ventures  

ethyleneamines joint venture.    since july 1, 2010, we have consolidated the results of aac, our
50%-owned joint venture with the zamil group. aac operates an ethyleneamines manufacturing plant in jubail, saudi arabia. the plant has an approximate annual capacity of 60 million pounds. we
purchase and sell all of the production from this joint venture. 


maleic anhydride joint venture.    since the second quarter of 2011, we have consolidated the results of sasol-huntsman, our
50%-owned maleic anhydride
joint venture. this entity operates a manufacturing facility in moers, germany with the capacity to produce 232 million pounds of maleic anhydride. the output from the facility is sold in the
european region. 







raw materials  

we have the capacity to produce 460 million pounds of ethylene and 300 million pounds of propylene, depending on feedstocks, at
our port neches, texas facility. all of the ethylene is used to produce eo and all of the propylene is used to produce po at our port neches, texas facility (primarily for our polyurethanes segment).
we have the capacity to use approximately 1,000 million pounds of ethylene each year in the production of eo and ethyleneamines. accordingly, we purchase or toll the remainder of our ethylene
requirements from third parties. we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg, surfactants, carbonates and amines products. we also use internally produced po and deg in the manufacture of
these products. 

in
addition to internally produced raw materials, the main raw materials used in the production of our amines are edc, caustic soda, ammonia, hydrogen, methylamines and acrylonitrile.
the majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices. 

maleic
anhydride is produced by the reaction of normal butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst. the principal raw material is normal butane, which is purchased pursuant to
long-term contracts and delivered to our pensacola, florida site by barge, to our facility in geismar, louisiana via pipeline and to our moers, germany site by railcar. our maleic anhydride catalyst
is toll-manufactured by a third party under a long-term contract according to our proprietary methods. these raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 


in
the production of surfactants and lab, our primary raw materials, in addition to internally produced and third-party sourced eo and ethylene, are synthetic and natural alcohols,
paraffin, alpha olefins, benzene and nonylphenol. all of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices.

raw materials  

the principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol a, mda, phenol and
aminophenols. we also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives. raw
material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of the costs for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general,
these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. formula pricing is sometimes used if advantageous for the business. 

additionally,
we produce large volumes of some of our most important raw materials, such as blr and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products.
approximately 63% of the blr we produce is consumed internally in our downstream products. the balance of our blr is sold in the merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our
production plants and lower our overall blr production cost. we believe that manufacturing a large proportion of our own blr gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based polymer systems
formulators, who buy blr from third-party suppliers. this position helps protect us from pricing pressure from blr suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of blr in difficult market
conditions. 

we
consume certain amines produced by our performance products segment and isocyanates produced by our polyurethanes segment, which we use to formulate advanced materials products.

pigments and additives  

our pigments and additives segment manufactures titanium dioxide, functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment
products. our broad product range, coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use
applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. in 2014, we acquired the performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses ("rockwood acquisition") of rockwood
holdings, inc. ("rockwood"), broadening our specialty titanium dioxide product offerings and adding significant scale and capacity to our titanium dioxide facilities. the rockwood acquisition
positioned us as a leader in the specialty and differentiated titanium dioxide industry segments, which includes products that sell at a premium and have more stable margins. the rockwood acquisition
also provided us with complementary functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. 


our
pigments and additives segment has 27 manufacturing facilities operating in 10 countries with a total production capacity of approximately 1.3 million metric tons per year. we
operate eight titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities in europe, north america and asia and 19 color pigments, functional additives, water treatment and timber treatment manufacturing and processing
facilities in europe, north america, asia and australia. 

we
have substantially transformed our pigments and additives segment in recent years and have firmly established ourselves as a market leader in the industries in which we operate. our
pigments and additives segment spent $1.3 billion from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2016 on acquisitions, restructuring and integration. we have recently identified plans for
additional business improvements in our pigments and additives segment, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2018 and deliver additional adjusted ebitda to our business. as a result of
these efforts, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on market recovery and growth opportunities, and maximize profitability as demand and prices increase. 

on
october 28, 2016, we filed an initial form 10 registration statement with the sec as part of the process to spin off our pigments and additives and textile effects
businesses in a tax-free transaction. on january 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our textile effects business and we amended the form 10 registration statement. we also
announced that the name of the spin-off entity will be venator. venator shares are expected to trade on the new york stock exchange under the ticker vntr after the distribution to our stockholders.
the completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the registration statement on form 10 for venator's common stock being declared
effective by the sec and certain other conditions described in the information statement included in the form 10. the ongoing process to separate the pigments and additives business is
proceeding and is targeted for the second quarter 2017. as noted in "—recent developments" above, there was fire damage sustained at our titanium dioxide facility in pori, finland. the
potential impact of this interruption, if any, on the spin date is not yet known.

products and markets  

titanium dioxide.    titanium dioxide is derived from titanium bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness,
opacity and brightness
to thousands of everyday items, including coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers, food and personal care products. we are one of the six major producers of titanium dioxide that collectively
account for approximately 60% of global tio2 production capacity according to tz mineral international pty ltd. ("tzmi"), an independent consulting company that reports market data for the
chemicals sector. producers of the remaining 40% are primarily single-plant producers that focus on regional sales. we are among the three largest global titanium dioxide producers, with nameplate
production capacity of approximately 782,000 metric tons per year, accounting for approximately 11% of global titanium dioxide production capacity. we are able to manufacture a broad range of titanium
dioxide products from functional to specialty. our specialty products sell at a premium into specialized applications such as fibers, catalysts, food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. by operating both
sulfate and chloride processes, we also have the ability to use a wide range of titanium feedstocks, which enhances the competitiveness of our manufacturing operations, by providing flexibility in the
selection of raw materials. this helps insulate us from price fluctuations for any particular feedstock and allows us to reduce our raw material costs. 

global
tio2 demand growth rates tend to track gdp growth rates over the medium term; however, this varies by region. developed markets such as the u.s. and western europe
exhibit higher consumption per person but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates. the tio2 industry experiences some
seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end-use markets. coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in
greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 

we
own a portfolio of brands including tioxide®, hombitan®, hombitec®, uvtitan® and altiris® used in connection with
materials, which are produced in our eight manufacturing facilities around the globe. we service over 2,300 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. our global manufacturing
footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global customers, including a. schulman, akzonobel, ampacet, basf, clariant, dsm, flint, ppg, polyone, sherwin-williams and sun chemical. 


there
are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. we believe that the chloride process accounts for
approximately 45% of global production capacity. our production capabilities are distinguished from some of our competitors because of our ability to manufacture titanium dioxide using both sulfate
and chloride manufacturing
processes, which gives us the flexibility to tailor our products to meet our customers' needs. most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that
prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing route—for example, the inks market prefers sulfate products and the automotive coatings market prefers chloride products. regional customers
typically favor products that are available locally. the sulfate process produces titanium dioxide in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty
applications. 

once
an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced using either the chloride or sulfate process, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics
for particular end-use applications. co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. in order to reduce our disposal costs and to
increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our titanium dioxide manufacturing. we sell approximately 60% of the co-products generated by our business. 


we
have an established broad customer base and have successfully differentiated ourselves by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche market segments where the
innovation

carboxylate driers. the cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength of iron oxide make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as
concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings and plastics. we produce a wide range of color pigments and are the world's second largest manufacturer of technical grade ultramarine blue pigments,
which have a unique blue shade and are widely used to correct colors, giving them a desirable clean, blue undertone. these attributes have resulted in ultramarine blue being used world-wide for
polymeric applications such as construction plastics, food packaging, automotive polymers, consumer plastics, coatings and cosmetics. 

our
products are sold under a portfolio of brands used in connection with items that are targeted to the construction sector such as davis colors™, granufin™ and
ferroxide™ and the following brands holliday pigments™, copperas red® and mapico™ used for products focused predominantly on the coatings and plastics
sectors. 

our
products are also used by manufacturers of colorants, rubber, paper, cosmetics, pet food, digital ink, toner and other industrial uses delivering benefits in other applications such
as corrosion protection and catalysis.

iron
oxide pigment's cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete,
brick and roof tile, and for coatings such as paints and plastics. we are one of the three largest synthetic inorganic color pigments producers which together represent more than 50% of the global
market for iron oxide pigments. the remaining market share consists primarily of chinese competitors. 


made
from clay, our ultramarine blue pigments are non-toxic, weather resistant and thermally stable. ultramarine blue is used world-wide for food contact applications. our synthetic
ultramarines are permitted for unrestricted use in certain cosmetics applications. ultramarine blue is used extensively in plastics and the paint industry. we focus on supplying our customers with
technical grade ultramarine blues and violets to high specification markets such as the cosmetics industry. 

we
are now commissioning a new production facility in augusta, georgia for the synthesis of iron oxide pigments, which we purchased from rockwood. during commissioning, the facility has
experienced delays producing products at the expected specifications and quantities, causing us to question the capabilities of the augusta technology. based on the facility's performance during the
commissioning process, we have concluded that production capacity at our augusta facility will be
substantially lower than originally anticipated. on february 6, 2017, we filed a lawsuit against rockwood, albemarle corporation (as rockwood's successor) and certain former rockwood executives
to recover damage for fraud and breach of contract involving the augusta technology. 

timber treatment and water treatment.    we manufacture wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial
applications to prolong
the service life of wood through protection from decay and fungal or insect attack. wood that has been treated with our products is sold to consumers through major branded retail outlets such as
lowe's. 

we
manufacture our timber treatment chemicals in the u.s. and market our products primarily in north america through viance, llc ("viance"), our 50%-owned joint venture with dow
chemical formed in 2007. our residential construction products such as acq, ecolife® and copper azole are sold for use in decking, fencing and other residential outdoor wood structures.
our industrial construction products such as chromated copper arsenate (cca) are sold for use in telephone poles and salt water piers and pilings. 


we
manufacture our water treatment chemicals in germany, and these products are used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications. we are one of europe's
largest suppliers of polyaluminium chloride (pac) based flocculants with approximately 140,000 metric

tons
of production capacity. our main markets are municipal and industrial waste water treatment and the paper industry. 







sales and marketing  

we serve over 9,000 customers through our pigments and additives segment. these customers produce paints and coatings, plastics, paper, printing
inks, fibers and films, pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, materials for the construction industry, catalyst applications and protect wood and treat water with our chemicals. approximately 85% of our
pigments and additives sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network. this network enables us to work directly with our customers and develop a deep
understanding of our
customers' needs and to develop valuable relationships. the remaining 15% of sales are made through our distribution network. we maximize the reach our distribution network by utilizing specialty
distributors in selected markets. 

larger
customers are typically served via our own sales network and these customers often have annual volume targets with associated pricing mechanisms. smaller customers are served
through a combination of our global sales teams and a distribution network, and the route to market decision is often dependent upon customer size and end application. 


we
sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through specialty distributors. we sell the majority of our timber treatment
products directly to end customers via our joint venture viance. 

our
focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. for example, we believe that our pigments and additives segment is well-positioned to
benefit from growth sectors, such as fibers and films, catalysts, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food, where customers' needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to
support them. we maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected markets. our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed
us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products. 







manufacturing and operations  


as of december 31, 2016, our pigments and additives segment has 27 manufacturing facilities operating in 10 countries with a total

a sulfate plant in umbogintwini, south africa, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2016, and our titanium dioxide finishing plant in calais, france.
(2)this
facility is owned and operated by lpc, a manufacturing joint venture that is owned 50% by us and 50% by kronos. the capacity shown reflects our 50%
interest in lpc.  
 
 





joint ventures  

u.s. titanium dioxide joint venture.    lpc is our 50%-owned unconsolidated joint venture with kronos. we share production offtake
and operating costs
of the plant with kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a
supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. our investment in lpc is accounted for using the equity method. 

u.s. timber treatment joint venture.    viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical. viance markets our timber
treatment products. our joint
venture interest in viance was acquired as part of the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. the joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our
harrisburg, north carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on viance's behalf. as a
result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and began consolidating viance upon the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. 







raw materials  

the primary raw materials used in our pigments and additives segment are as follows: 
 

 
 


















 
 
titanium dioxide 
 
functional additives 
 
color pigments 
 
timber treatment 
 
water chemicals 


primary raw materials
 
titanium bearing ore, sulfuric acid, chlorine
 
barium and zinc based inorganics
 
iron oxide particles, scrap iron, copperas alkali
 
dcoit, copper, monoethanolamine
 
aluminum oxide



 
the
primary raw materials that are used to produce titanium dioxide are various types of titanium feedstock, which include ilmenite, rutile, titanium slag (chloride slag and sulfate
slag) and synthetic rutile. according to tzmi, the world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the four largest accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. the
majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from india, africa, canada and norway. ore accounts for approximately 45% 

30




 

table of contents

of
titanium dioxide variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 30% of variable manufacturing costs. 

the
majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per year.
this form of market-based ore contract provides flexibility and responsiveness in terms of pricing and quantity obligations. 

the
primary raw materials for functional additives production are barite and zinc. we currently source material barite from china, where we have long standing supplier relationships and
pricing is negotiated largely on a purchase by purchase basis. the quality of zinc required for our business is mainly mined in australia but can also be sourced from canada and south america. the
majority of our zinc is sourced from two key suppliers with whom we have long standing relationships. 


we
source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from china, the u.s., france and italy. key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from
various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 

the
primary raw materials for our timber treatment business are dichloro-octylisothiazolinone ("dcoit") and copper. we source the raw materials for the majority of our timber treatment
business from china and the u.s. dcoit is sourced on a long term contract whereas copper is procured from various mid-size and larger producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 


the
primary raw materials for our water treatment business are aluminum hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which are widely available from a number of sources and typically
sourced through long term contracts. we also use sulfuric acid which we source internally. 







competition  

the global markets in which our pigments and additives segment operates are highly competitive and vary according to product. 


competition
within the standard grade titanium dioxide market is based on price, product quality and service. our key competitors are chemours, tronox, kronos and cristal, each of which
is a major global producer with the ability to service all global markets and billions, a chinese titanium dioxide producer. if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology
that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. moreover, the sulfate based titanium dioxide technology used by our
pigments and additives segment is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our
ability to capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 


competition
within the specialty titanium dioxide market and the color pigments market is based on customer service, technical expertise in the customers' applications, product
attributes (such as product form and quality) and price. product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely
impacts consistency in the end-product. our primary competitors within specialty titanium dioxide include fuji titanium industry, kronos and precheza. our primary competitors within color pigments
include lanxess ag, cathay pigments group, ferro corporation and shanghai yipin pigments co., ltd. 


competition
within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and price. key competitors for barium-based additives
include solvay s.a., sakai chemical industry co., ltd., 20 microns ltd. and chinese barium producers. key competitors for zinc-based additives include chinese lithopone
producers.

competition
within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology and product range. our primary competitors are lonza group and koppers.
competition within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. our primary competitors are kemira and feralco. 







research and development  

for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent $152 million, $160 million and $158 million,
respectively, on research and development. 

we
support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. our research and development centers are located in
the woodlands, texas; everberg, belgium; and shanghai, china. other regional development/technical service centers are located in wynyard, england and duisburg, germany (pigments and additives);
auburn hills, michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); derry, new hampshire, shanghai, china, deggendorf, germany and ternate, italy (polyurethanes); melbourne, australia (surfactants);
port neches, texas (process engineering support); basel, switzerland and panyu, china (advanced materials and textile effects); and mumbai, india (textile effects). 







intellectual property rights  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. we own approximately
3,015 unexpired global patents and have approximately 1,370 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending. while a
presumption of validity exists with respect to issued u.s. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore,
we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive
technologies. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 

we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. there can be no
assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or
proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. in addition, there can be no assurance that
others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 

in
addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to
use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. we also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to
third parties. 

we
have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 4,080 global trademark registrations and 235 pending registrations. some of these registrations
and applications include filings under the madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. however, there can be no assurance that the trademark
registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. 


because
of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for
which we intend to 

32




 

table of contents

maintain
the applicable registrations) is material to our business. moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years,
either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 







employees  

as of december 31, 2016, we employed approximately 15,000 associates in our operations around the world. approximately 3,000 of these
employees are located in the u.s., while approximately 12,000 are located in other countries. we believe our relations with our employees are good. 







geographic data  

for sales revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see "note 26. operating segment information" to our consolidated financial
statements. 







environmental, health and safety matters  







general  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, pollution,
protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste
materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in addition,
our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws
or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some environmental laws, the
assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or
operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. information related to environmental, health
and safety ("ehs") matters may also be found in other areas of this report including "—item 1a. risk factors," "note 2. summary of significant accounting
policies—environmental expenditures" to our consolidated financial statements and "note 21. environmental health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 







environmental, health and safety systems  

we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable ehs legal requirements, and we have developed policies and
management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our
employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are
frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 







environmental remediation  

we have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former
facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that 

33




 

table of contents

was
disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 

in
cases where our potential liability arises from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we
frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual
covenants for a number of
sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. we cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior
owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. 

based
on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not
have a material effect on our financial statements. however, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to
such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. at the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to
remediate contamination sites. 







regulatory matters  







greenhouse gas regulation and climate change  

globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("ghgs"), such as carbon
dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the durban negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations,
including the european union (the "eu"), agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the eu
ghg emissions trading system ("ets"), established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the eu, continues in its third phase. the eu parliament has used a process to formalize
"backloading"—the withholding of ghg allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices.
as backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ets. the european commission proposes to establish a
market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system's resilience. the reserve will start operating in 2019. in addition, the eu has announced the binding
target to reduce domestic ghg emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. the european commission proposed an objective of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the
eu's energy consumption by 2030. the european council endorsed this target, which is binding at the eu level. the european commission also proposed a 30% energy savings target for 2030. the european
council, however, endorsed an indicative target of 27% to be reviewed in 2020 having in mind a 30% target. 

in
addition, at the 2015 united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, the u.s. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which
entered into effect in november 2016. although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their ghg emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce
future emissions. the u.s. is one of over 100 nations that have indicated an intent to comply with the agreement. 

federal
climate change legislation in the u.s. appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will continue to be led by the u.s. environmental
protection agency's (the "epa") ghg regulations and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and
operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act's (the "caa")
requirements for 

34




 

table of contents

pollutants
regulated under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs. some of our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and any
further regulation may increase our operational costs. in addition, under a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the epa is due to propose new source performance standards for ghg
emissions from refineries. these standards could significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of
refined products. either of these events could have an adverse effect on our business. 

we
are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to u.s. federal and state requirements, kyoto protocol
obligations and/or ets requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although
it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and/or
increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future
regulation on any of our sites. 

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant
physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our
assets and operations

item 1a.    risk factors        

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.







risks related to the proposed spin-off  







the proposed spin-off of our pigments and additives businesses is contingent upon the satisfaction of a
number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us if not completed.  

on october 28, 2016, we announced plans to spin off our pigments and additives business into a separate, publicly traded company,
venator. completion of the proposed spin-off is subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions that could delay, prevent, or otherwise
adversely affect the spin-off. completion of the spin-off will be contingent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, authorization and approval of our board of directors, receipt of a
private letter ruling from the irs, receipt of a tax opinion regarding the 

36




 

table of contents

tax-free
status of the spin-off, completion of new financing arrangements, execution of ancillary agreements, and the effectiveness of a registration statement with the sec. there can be no assurance
that the spin-off will be completed as expected, if at all. 

in
pursuing the proposed spin-off, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences, including, but not limited to, the
following:



• execution of the proposed spin-off will require significant time and attention from management, which may postpone the execution of other
initiatives that may have been beneficial to us; 
• completion of the spin-off will require strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations, which
could lead to a disruption of our operations and loss of, or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and to complete the proposed spin-off;  
• completion of the spin-off may require certain management and procedural redundancies as we prepare for the spin-off, which may result in
operating inefficiencies; and 
• we will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees, whether
or not it is completed. 


we
may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spin-off. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock. 







we may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the proposed spin-off.  

we may not achieve some or all of the financial, operational, managerial, and other anticipated benefits from the proposed spin-off, or the
spin-off may not provide such benefits on the scale we anticipate for a variety of reasons. in addition, we will incur one-time costs in connection with the spin-off that may negate some of the
benefits we expect to achieve. 







if the proposed spin-off of our pigments and additives business is completed, the trading price of our common
stock will likely decline.  

we expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the proposed spin-off to be lower than immediately preceding the spin-off,
as the trading price of our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our pigments and additives business. in addition, we can not assure you that that the combined value of the common stock of
the two publicly-traded companies following the completion of the spin-off, as adjusted for any changes in the combined capitalization of these companies, will be equal to or greater than what the
value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spin-off not occurred. until the market has fully evaluated the business of our company without its pigments and additives segment, the price
at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. similarly, until the market has fully evaluated venator, the price at which venator's common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. 







the proposed spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.  

the proposed spin-off is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under section 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue
code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). we are seeking, and completion of the spin-off is conditioned upon the receipt of, a private letter ruling from the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") to the
effect that our retention of venator class a common stock will not be in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of federal income tax, that certain
post-spin-off exchanges of such venator stock for our company's indebtedness will be treated as tax-free under section 355 and 361 of the code and that certain payments or 

37




 

table of contents

transfers
of assets and liabilities that may occur following the spin-off will be treated as part of the spin-off transaction (the "irs ruling"). if the irs ruling is received, our tax counsel is
expected to issue an opinion that our pro rata distribution of all outstanding venator class b common stock to our stockholders qualifies as a tax-free transaction under sections 355,
361 and/or 368(a)(1)(d) of the code and that certain elements of the restructuring transactions undertaken as part of the spin-off will also qualify for tax-free treatment under sections 355,
361 and/or 368(a)(1)(d) of the code (the "tax opinion"). 

the
tax-free treatment of the spin-off will be contingent on the continued validity of the irs ruling and the tax opinion, both of which will be based on certain facts, representations
and undertakings. if any of such facts, representations or undertakings are not correct, are incomplete, or are violated, the irs ruling could be revoked or modified by the irs and our company's
ability to rely on the tax opinion could be jeopardized. if the spin-off distribution, and/or related internal transactions, were determined to be taxable, huntsman or venator could incur significant
u.s. federal income tax liabilities. in addition, if the spin-off were deemed to be taxable, each holder of huntsman common stock who received shares of venator would generally be treated as receiving
a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of venator received. 

even
if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment, the distribution may result in a corporate-level taxable gain to our company if 50 percent or more, by vote or
value, of huntsman or venator common stock, is treated as acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. in that event, while our company would
recognize a taxable gain as described above, the distribution would be tax-free to our common stockholders. 







risks related to our business  







our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile economic
conditions.  

our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the u.s., europe and asia. declining economic conditions in
all or any of these locations—or negative perceptions about economic conditions—could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our
business. the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. for example, our operations in asia have
been impacted by slower growth in china, which continues to adversely affect demand for some of our products. uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us
to forecast demand trends. as a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations.
we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the industries in which we operate. 








the markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed market
conditions for such products.  

the cyclicality that the markets for many of our products experience occurs as a result of alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices
and margins to increase, followed by periods of lower capacity utilization, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins. the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of
changes in the demand for products as a consequence of global economic activity, changes in energy prices and changes in customers' requirements. for example, demand for our products depends in part
on the housing and construction industries, which are cyclical in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy. in addition, margins for mtbe sales are volatile and seasonal.
the supply-demand balance is also impacted by capacity additions or reductions that result in changes in utilization rates. the cyclicality and volatility 

38




 

table of contents

of
our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle. 


primarily
as a result of oversupply in the market, global prices for titanium dioxide declined throughout 2015 before reaching a trough in the first quarter of 2016. although this market
has experienced recent success in implementing price increases and increasing margins, there can be no assurances that the market will recover fully to historically normalized levels. furthermore, the
market could deteriorate to conditions worse than the trough experienced in the first quarter of 2016. if selling prices and margins do not recover fully to historically normalized levels or worsen,
our results of operations and/or financial condition could be negatively impacted. 








disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and/or financial condition.  

manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds, outages and other disruptions.
any serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. alternative
facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, any of which could negatively
impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. long-term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our
profitability. 

unplanned
production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political
unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. any such production disruption could have a material impact on our operations, operating
results and financial condition. 

in
addition, we rely on a number of vendors, suppliers, and in some cases sole-source suppliers, service providers, toll manufacturers and collaborations with other industry participants
to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities that we need to operate our business. if the business of these third
parties is disrupted, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. if this were to occur, it could adversely affect
their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products.
moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements
for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity. 

while
we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances
that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change. in addition, insurance may not
adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not
available at all. furthermore, some potential climate-driven losses, particularly inundation due to sea-level rise, may pose long-term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be
restored in their current locations.

our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes.  

we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the u.s., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with
international operations. these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could
result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. we transact business in many foreign currencies, including euros, swiss francs, chinese renminbi, indian rupees, brazilian reals
and thai bahts. we translate our local currency financial results into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that
period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer u.s. dollars. because we currently
have significant operations located outside the u.s., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements. 

other
risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, cash repatriation restrictions, national and regional labor strikes, social and political
risks, general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of u.s. and foreign laws, including monetary policies, tax laws, the foreign corrupt practices act (and foreign equivalents),
export controls and regulations administered by the office of foreign assets control. any changes in tariffs or trade barriers could make our products less competitive compared to other producers not
subject to the same tariffs or trade barriers. any decision to repatriate cash as dividends could subject us to foreign and u.s. federal and state income taxes without any offsetting foreign
tax credit relief. although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program
may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.
furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where legal processes may vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices
vary, we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems. the occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international
subsidiaries, which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us. 

we
operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the
jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. in addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap" or "u.s. gaap") have required us to place
valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions. these valuation allowances result from analysis of positive and
negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax jurisdictions. changes in valuation allowances
have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new
valuation allowances. while significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations. furthermore, certain foreign jurisdictions may
take actions to delay our ability to collect value-added tax refunds. 








our efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our strategies are
unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

we continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change. these initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and
joint ventures, divesting assets, restructuring our existing operations and assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant
investment and subject us to new kinds of risks. we have incurred 

40




 

table of contents

indebtedness
to finance these opportunities, and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future initiatives. we could also issue additional shares of stock of our company or our subsidiaries
to finance such initiatives. if our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and
diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted. 

the
implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including:



• diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations; 
• requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses;  
• disruptions to important business relationships; 
• increased operating costs; 
• limitations imposed by various governmental entities; 
• use of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants; and 
• difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter. 


our
inability to mitigate these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. in addition, we may fail to fully achieve the savings or growth projected for current or future initiatives notwithstanding the expenditure of substantial
resources in pursuit thereof. see "risks related to the proposed spin-off" above for specific risks related to the proposed spin-off of our pigments and additives business. 







we may have difficulties integrating acquired businesses and as a result, our business, results of operations
and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

we have completed a number of acquisitions and we will continue to acquire additional businesses and enter into joint ventures as part of our
business strategy. growth through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks, including:



• inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses and products; 
• inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures;  
• unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business; 
• difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses; 
• difficulties in realizing projected synergies; and 
• exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability or illegal activities conducted by an
acquired company or a joint venture partner. 


our
inability to address these risks could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. 







significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs
that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability.  

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials from third-party suppliers and the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial
portion of our operating expenses. the prices for a number 

41




 

table of contents

of
these raw materials generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. for example, the market for
crude oil and natural gas feedstocks experienced depressed pricing throughout 2015 and 2016, leading to favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchase from third parties. lower raw material
prices, however, can lead to downward pressure on selling prices for certain of our products leading to reduced revenue. any rebound in the pricing for such feedstocks could adversely affect our
operating expenses. our supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. while we attempt to match cost increases with
corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract
product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. any cost increase that we are not able to pass on
to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic chemical commodity products that are readily available at market prices. there are, however, several raw
materials for which there are only a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier. for example, titanium-containing feedstocks suitable for use in our titanium dioxide facilities are available
from a limited number of suppliers around the world. to mitigate potential supply constraints, we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers, evaluate alternative sources of
supply and evaluate alternative technologies to avoid reliance on limited or sole-source suppliers. in addition, where supply relationships are concentrated, particular attention is paid by the
parties to ensure strategic intentions are aligned to facilitate long-term planning. if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced
to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. any
interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. the inability of a supplier to meet our raw material needs could have a
material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations. 

the
number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is also specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located. political and economic
instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability. in addition, if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from
which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes. we may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect our
profitability. we may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher production costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce our earnings and decrease
our liquidity. 







the industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with
our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and major
integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position in various products
and markets throughout the world. some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial
resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. 

while
we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine existing products and processes, and to develop new
applications 

42




 

table of contents

for
existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive. moreover, if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary
technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. 

further,
it is possible that we could abandon certain products, processes, or applications due to potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights or that we could be
named in future litigation for the infringement or misappropriation of a competitor's or other third party's intellectual property rights, which could include a claim for injunctive relief and
damages, and, if so, such adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. in addition, certain of our competitors in various
countries in which we do business, including china, may be owned by or affiliated with members of local governments and political entities. these competitors may get special treatment with respect to
regulatory compliance and product registration, while certain of our products, including those based on new technologies, may be delayed or even prevented from entering into the local market. 


certain
of our businesses use technology that is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of our
business. the entrance of new competitors into any of our businesses may reduce our ability to maintain margins or capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry
is increasing. further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand their roles significantly in the future. increased competition
in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect
our critical information technology systems could materially affect our operations.  

we rely on information technology systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain and financial information and various
other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. information technology system failures, network
disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions or
reporting of financial results. an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our
customers or employees, which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation. 

we
have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information,
or disruption of our operations. current employees have, and former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our
competitors or otherwise used to harm us. moreover, our operations in certain locations, such as china, may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems. any breach of our security
measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information, corruption of data or disruption of operations or transactions, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business. 

in
addition, we could be required to expend significant additional amounts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches. we
may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the significant risks to our information technology systems.

our significant debt level, a portion of which is subject to variable interest rates, makes us vulnerable to
downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to obtain additional financing or to refinance our debt.  

we have significant outstanding debt. as of december 31, 2016, our total consolidated outstanding debt was $4,196 million
(including current portion of debt); our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 74%; our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately $2.2 billion; and our
current portion of debt totaled $60 million. our debt level and the fact that a significant percentage of our cash flow is required to make payments on our debt could have important
consequences for our business, including but not limited to the following:



• we may be more vulnerable to business, industry or economic downturns, making it more difficult to respond to market conditions;  
• cash flow available for other purposes, including the growth of our business, may be reduced; 
• our ability to refinance or obtain additional financing may be constrained, particularly during periods when the capital markets are unsettled;  
• our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us; and 
• part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates (for example, a 1%
increase in interest rates, without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items, would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $22 million). 


our
debt level also impacts our credit ratings. any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could
result in increased interest and other costs. 







agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or to obtain
additional financing.  

the agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants. these covenants may limit or prohibit our ability to among
other things, incur additional indebtedness; make certain prepayments of debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; issue stock; make investments; create liens; enter into
transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. some of our strategies may necessitate receiving consents or waivers under
our debt arrangements, which could be withheld. 

our
failure to comply with any of our debt covenants, or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt, could result in a default, or trigger cross-default or
acceleration provisions, under
our debt agreements. an event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, cause our creditors to terminate their lending commitments, or force us or one or
more of our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. for more
information regarding our debt covenants, see "note 15. debt—compliance with covenants" to our consolidated financial statements. 







economic conditions and regulatory changes following the united kingdom's likely exit from the eu could
adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition.  

following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the united kingdom (the "u.k.") approved an exit from the eu, it is expected that the
u.k. government will initiate a process to leave the eu (often referred to as brexit). the referendum triggered short-term financial volatility, including a decline in the value of the pound sterling
in comparison to both the u.s. dollar and euro. the future 

44




 

table of contents

effects
of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to the eu or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. given the lack of comparable
precedent and the uncertainty around when the u.k. government will initiate the process to leave the eu, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the u.k. from the
eu would have and how such withdrawal would affect our company. 

we
derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside the u.s., including 29% from europe. the consequences of brexit, together with what may be protracted negotiations
around the terms of brexit, could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. brexit could also create
uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers in the u.k. are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. government
determines which eu laws to replace or replicate. 

while
we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility
in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition. all of these potential consequences could
be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the eu. 







our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our profitability.  

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards
inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical and other products. these hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or
hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. we are also potentially subject to other
hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor
difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. in addition, some equipment and operations at our facilities are owned or controlled by third parties who may not be fully integrated into our
safety programs and over whom we are able to exercise limited control. many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and
environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with
respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters. 

we
maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance
policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. each of these
insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles
for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a
significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. for more information, see
"—item 3. legal proceedings" below. 

45






 



































table of contents 







we are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or
liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the
environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. actual or alleged
violations of environmental, health and safety, or ehs, laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as
well as, under some ehs laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. 

many
of our products and operations are subject to the chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. these laws include the regulation of chemical substances and
inventories under the toxic substances control act ("tsca") in the united states and the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals ("reach") and the classification, labelling and
packaging of substances
and mixtures ("clp") regulations in europe. analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including china, south korea, and taiwan. in addition, a number of countries where we operate,
including the united kingdom, have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a
multi-year implementation period for these rules. 

additional
new laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. for example, in the u.s., the epa finalized revisions to its risk management
program in january 2017. the revisions include new requirements for certain facilities to perform hazard analyses, third-party auditing, incident investigations and root cause analyses, emergency
response exercises, and to publically share chemical and process information. compliance for many of the rule's new requirements will be required beginning in 2021. in january 2017, the epa
temporarily delayed the rule's effect until march 21, 2017, and has indicated that it may further delay the rule's implementation. the u.s. occupational safety and health administration is
likewise considering changes to its process safety management standards. in addition, tsca reform legislation was enacted in june 2016, and the epa has begun the process of issuing new chemical
control regulations. the costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined. 


our
international operations may also be impacted by new laws or regulations. for example, pursuant to the clp, an eu member state can propose a classification for a substance to the
european chemicals agency ("echa"), which upon review by echa's committee for risk assessment ("rac"), can be submitted to the european commission for adoption by regulation. on may 31, 2016,
the french agency for food, environmental and occupational health and safety ("anses") submitted a proposal to echa that would classify titanium dioxide a category 1b carcinogen classification
as presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans by inhalation. potential outcomes before both the rac and the commission is a final classification as a category 1b carcinogen (described
by the eu regulation as "presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans, classification is largely based on human evidence"), a category 2 carcinogen classification (described by the eu
regulation as "suspected human carcinogens," classification on the basis of evidence obtained from human and/or animal studies, but which is not sufficiently convincing to place the substance in
category 1a or 1b), or a decision of no classification, with the commission making the final decision. our company, together with other companies, relevant trade associations and the european
chemical industry council ("cefic") sector group, the titanium dioxide manufacturers association ("tdma"), submitted comments opposing any classification of titanium dioxide as carcinogenic, based on
evidence from multiple epidemiological studies covering more than 24,000 production workers at 18 titanium dioxide manufacturing sites over several decades that found no increased incidence of lung
cancer as a result of workplace exposure to titanium dioxide and other 

46




 

table of contents

scientific
studies that concluded that the response to lung overload studies with poorly soluble particles upon which the anses proposed classification is based is unique to the rat and is not seen in
other animal species or humans. if echa were to recommend, and the european commission were to
subsequently adopt, either a category 1b or category 2 carcinogen classification, it could require that many end-use products manufactured would be classified as containing a potential
carcinogenic component, which could negatively impact public perception of products containing titanium dioxide, limit the marketability of and demand for titanium dioxide or products containing
titanium dioxide and potentially have spill-over, restrictive effects under other eu laws, e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food
additives. such classifications would also affect manufacturing operations by subjecting us to new work place requirements that could significantly increase costs. the resulting restrictions in the
market place and impact on operations and profitability would be less significant in the event of a category 2 classification for titanium dioxide compared to the category 1b
classification proposed by anses. 

furthermore,
governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent
regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. in addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our
reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. moreover, changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to
modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our
profitability. for example, several of our products are being evaluated under reach and clp regulations and actions thereunder could negatively impact sales. 







regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  

our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be
contributing to changes in the earth's climate. there are existing efforts to address ghg emissions at the international, national, and regional levels. for example, the 2015 paris climate summit
agreement resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their ghg emissions. the agreement entered into force on november 4, 2016 and could result in additional firm
commitments by various nations with respect to future ghg emissions. the eu also regulates ghgs under the eu ets and china has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of ghg emissions in
selected areas. domestically, the epa issued its final clean power plan rules in 2015 that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called co2 emission performance rates. in
february 2016, the u.s. supreme court granted a stay of the implementation of the clean power plan. this stay will remain in effect until the conclusion of the appeals process. it is not yet clear how
the courts will rule on the legality of the clean power plan. if the rules are upheld at the conclusion of this appellate process, and depending on how states decide to implement these rules, they may
result in national or regional credit trading schemes. collectively, these rules and agreements may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that
contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. these various regulations and agreements are likely to result in increased costs to purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or
modification of ghg emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use.
compliance with these regulations and any more stringent restrictions in the future may increase our operational costs. 


in
addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes, such as increased frequency and severity of
storms, droughts,

floods
and other climatic events. if any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 


we
could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws. capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory
requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently
anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws. 

furthermore,
we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or
arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase of our businesses. we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond
those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws. 







our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims against us,
including antitrust claims.  

we face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property and
environmental claims. it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity, or which may be beyond the
amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies, and we have been named as a
defendant in the antitrust suits discussed in "—item 3. legal proceedings—antitrust matters." in this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages,
which may be significant. an adverse outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. 








financial difficulties and related problems experienced by our customers, vendors, suppliers and other
business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

during periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies,
restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability. a significant adverse
change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that
customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. 







our business is dependent on our intellectual property. if our intellectual property rights cannot be
enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. while a presumption of validity exists
with respect to patents issued to us in the u.s., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, if any
pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then our
ability to compete may be adversely affected. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in
a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 


we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. while it is our policy
to enter 

48




 

table of contents

into
agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be breached, may not provide
meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade secrets and
know-how. in addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 

we
may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation
or infringement in countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to
the same extent as u.s. law. 

the
failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or the failure of adequate legal
remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, political events and general instability, along with
increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business.  

conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and political events have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in international commerce
and the global economy. the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our
suppliers or customers. accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. furthermore, instability and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases. 


changes
in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and
countries where we currently develop and sell products, could adversely affect our business. for example, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of
chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 







if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make payment on
our debts.  

our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries. because a significant portion of our
operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt
at maturity, are dependent to a large extent
upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries. any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us could be
subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our
subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our nonguarantor subsidiaries. in addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our
subsidiaries' earnings. 

our
subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any
funds 

49




 


table of contents

available
for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. any right that we have to receive
any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the
sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary. 







regulatory or market changes with respect to mtbe may materially reduce our sales and/or materially increase
our costs.  

we produce mtbe, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline.
because of the allegations that mtbe has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the u.s. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the u.s. market.
we currently market mtbe, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the u.s. this business has been profitable to us over time, and future legislative or
regulatory initiatives or changing consumer opinion outside the u.s. restricting mtbe or changing consumer opinion could materially adversely affect our ability to market and sell mtbe and our
profitability. expansion of our po/mtbe operations, including our joint venture with sinopec in china, will further expose us to these risks. 


while
we could use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe, this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities.
moreover, the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe. 







our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and under certain
circumstances we may have to significantly increase the level of cash funding to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business.  


we have unfunded and underfunded obligations under some of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. the funded status
of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations.
unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash
available for our business. in addition, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect
the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. 


with
respect to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, the pension benefit guaranty corporation ("pbgc") has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified
pension plan under limited circumstances in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended. in the event our tax-qualified pension plans are terminated by the pbgc, we
could be liable to the pbgc for the entire amount of the underfunding and, under certain circumstances, the liability could be senior to our notes. with respect to our foreign pension and
postretirement benefit plans, the effects of underfunding depend on the country in which the pension and postretirement benefit plan is established. for example, in the united kingdom and germany
semi-public pension protection programs have the authority in certain circumstances to assume responsibility for underfunded pension schemes, including the right to recover the amount of the
underfunding from us.

risks related to our common stock and debt securities  







certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover
attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value.  


certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of
stockholders, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company, even if
some of our stockholders were to consider such a change of
control to be beneficial. our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. therefore, our board of directors could elect
to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common
stock at a price higher than the current market value. 







we have purchased, and may continue to purchase, a portion of our equity and debt securities, which could
impact the market for our equity and debt securities and likely would negatively affect our liquidity.  

consistent with past practices, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our equity and debt securities in open market purchases,
accelerated repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full calls for redemption or otherwise. any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount
thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. such transactions could negatively affect our liquidity.

recent developments  

on january 30, 2017, our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in pori, finland experienced fire damage and is currently not
operational. the fire brigade responded quickly to
extinguish the fire and there were no injuries. we have notified applicable customers and suppliers of this force majeure event. we do not currently
have an estimated time frame for how long the facility will be off line, but we are committed to repairing the facility as quickly as possible. the pori facility has a nameplate capacity of 130,000
metric tons, which represents approximately 15% of our total titanium dioxide capacity and approximately 10% of total european titanium dioxide demand. the site is insured for property damage as well
as business interruption losses. according to our insurance policies, the respective retention levels (deductibles) for physical damage and business interruption are $15 million and
60 days, respectively. on february 9, 2017, we received a €50 million (approximately $52 million) payment from our insurer as an initial partial progress
payment towards the overall pending claim. 

on
october 28, 2016, we filed an initial form 10 registration statement with the sec as part of the process to spin off our pigments and additives and textile effects
businesses in a tax-free transaction. on january 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our textile effects business and we amended the form 10 registration statement. we also
announced that the name of the spin-off entity will be venator materials corporation. venator shares are expected to trade on the new york stock exchange under the ticker vntr after the distribution
to our stockholders. the completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the registration statement on form 10 for venator's common
stock being declared effective by the sec and certain other conditions described in the information statement included in the form 10. the ongoing process to separate the pigments and additives
business is proceeding and is targeted for the second quarter 2017. as noted above, there was fire damage sustained at our titanium dioxide facility in pori, finland. the potential impact of this
interruption, if any, on the spin date is not yet known. 

on
december 30, 2016, our performance products segment completed the sale of its european surfactants business to innospec inc. for $199 million in cash plus our
retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. under the terms of the transaction, innospec acquired our manufacturing facilities located in saint-mihiel,
france; castiglione delle stiviere, italy; and barcelona, spain. the purchase price is subject to the finalization of working capital adjustments. we remain committed to our global surfactants
business, including in the u.s. and australia, where our differentiated surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks. upon closing the transaction, we entered into supply
and long-term tolling arrangements with innospec in order to continue marketing certain core products strategic to our global agrochemicals, lubes and certain other businesses. in connection with this
sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $98 million. 


on
december 30, 2016, we made an early repayment of $260 million on our 2015 extended term loan b using proceeds from the sale of the european surfactants business and
existing cash. 







outlook  

we expect the following factors to impact our operating segments: 








polyurethanes: 



• continued focus on downstream mdi differentiation 
• improving mdi demand growth 

61




 

table of contents



• low mtbe margins 
• planned maintenance at rotterdam production facility 








performance products: 



• amines and maleic anhydride showing signs of recovery 
• margins lower than historical norms 
• planned ethylene oxide maintenance during second half of 2017 








advanced materials: 



• strong aerospace market more than one-third of earnings 








pigments and additives: 



• increasing tio2 selling prices 
• impact of fire at pori, finland manufacturing facility 
• lawsuit against rockwood and albemarle for fraud and breach of contract related to augusta facility 


in
2017, we expect to spend approximately $400 million on capital expenditures. 

in
2016, our adjusted effective tax rate was 22%. we expect our long term adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 30%. we believe our 2017 adjusted effective tax rate will be
slightly less than the long term rate.

for each of our company and huntsman international, the following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended

nm—notmeaningful
(1)our
management uses adjusted ebitda to assess financial performance. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as
appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following
adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting adjustments; (b) ebitda from discontinued operations; (c) (gain) loss on disposition of
businesses/assets; (d) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (e) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (f) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses;
(g) net plant incident remediation costs; (h) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs; and (i) spin-off separation expenses. we believe that net income of
huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted
ebitda. 


we
believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing the businesses' ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items
that management believes are not indicative of the businesses' operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. however, this measure should not be considered in
isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income of huntsman

corporation
or huntsman international, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. moreover, adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. our management believes this measure is useful to compare general
operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different
companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. for example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a
company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. in addition, the tax positions of companies
can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. as a result, effective tax rates and
tax expense can vary considerably among companies. finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. this can
result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. 

nevertheless,
our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income of huntsman
corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance. for example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and interest expense is a
necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted ebitda by using this measure to supplement u.s. gaap results to
provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than u.s. gaap results alone. 

in
addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe it is
useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific
underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in
future periods, may not be indicative of future results. for example, while ebitda from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or
future results.  



(2)adjusted
net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman
international, as appropriate: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting adjustments; (b) impact of certain foreign tax credit elections; (c) loss
from discontinued operations; (d) (gain) loss on disposition of businesses/assets; (e) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses;
(g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident remediation costs; and (i) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition
costs; (j) spin-off separation expenses. basic adjusted net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. adjusted diluted net income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. adjusted net income and adjusted
net income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information.

(3)the
income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total
adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. we do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it
provides more meaningful information than is provided under gaap.
(4)includes
costs associated with transition activities relating to the migration of our information system data centers and the transition of our textile effects
segment's production from basel, switzerland to a tolling facility. these transition costs were included in either selling, general and administrative expenses or cost of sales on our consolidated
statements of operations.
(5)capital
expenditures, net of reimbursements, represent cash paid for capital expenditures less payments received as reimbursements from customers and joint venture
partners. during 2016, 2015 and 2014, capital expenditures of $421 million, $663 million and $601 million, respectively, were reimbursed in part by $31 million,
$15 million and $37 million, respectively.
(6)management
internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate the company's liquidity, (b) to evaluate strategic investments, (c) to plan
stock buyback and dividend levels, and (d) to evaluate the company's ability to incur and service debt. free cash flow is not a defined term under u.s. gaap, and it should not be
inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. the company defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operating activities and used in investing
activities, excluding acquisition and disposition activities. free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company's consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for
items that affect comparability between periods.  
 
 





year ended december 31, 2016 compared with year ended december 31, 2015  

for the year ended december 31, 2016, net income attributable to huntsman corporation was $326 million on revenues of
$9,657 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman corporation of $93 million on revenues of $10,299 million for the same period of 2015. for the year ended
december 31, 2016, net income attributable to huntsman international was $323 million on revenues of $9,657 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman
international of $94 million on revenues of $10,299 million for the same period of 2015. the increase of $233 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the
increase of $229 million in net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



• revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased by $642 million, or 6%, as compared with the 2015 period. the decrease
was primarily due to lower average selling prices in all our segments and lower sales volumes in our performance products and advanced materials segments. see "—segment analysis" below.  
• our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased by $170 million
each, or 9% each, as compared with the 2015 period. the decrease resulted from lower gross margins in our polyurethanes, performance products and advanced materials segments. see "—segment
analysis" below. 
• our operating expenses and the operating expenses of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased by
$70 million and $69 million, respectively, or 6% each, as compared with the 2015 period, primarily related to the impact of translating foreign currency amounts to the u.s. dollar and a
decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of cost savings from restructuring programs within our pigments and additives segment. 
• restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased to $81 million from
$302 million in the 2015 period. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial
statements.

table of contents 



• in connection with the proposed spin-off of our pigments and additives business, we recorded spin-off separation expenses of $18 million
during 2016. we expect to record additional spin-off separation expenses of approximately $56 million in 2017. 
• our other operating income, net and other operating income, net of huntsman international increased by $139 million and
$140 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily related to a gain on the sale of our european surfactants business in the fourth quarter
of 2016. for more information concerning the sale of our european surfactants business, see "note 3. business combinations and dispositions—sale of european surfactants
manufacturing facilities" to our consolidated financial statements. 
• loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased to $3 million from $31 million in the
2015 period. during 2016, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $3 million primarily related to repayment of our term loan b facilities due 2017 and our term loan c facility due
2016 ("term loan c") as well as voluntary repayments on our 2015 extended term loan b. during 2015, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million primarily related to the
redemption of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due 2021 ("2021 senior subordinated notes"). 
• our income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased to $87 million from $46 million in the 2015 period.
the income tax expense of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased to $86 million from $45 million in 2015. our tax expense is significantly affected
by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. for further information concerning
taxes, see "note 19. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the decrease in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower average selling prices, partially
offset by higher sales volumes. mdi
average selling prices decreased in response to lower raw material costs. mtbe average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of lower pricing for high octane gasoline. mdi sales volumes
increased due to higher demand in the americas and european regions. po/mtbe sales volumes increased primarily due to the impact of the prior year planned maintenance outage. the decrease in segment
adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower mtbe margins, partially offset by higher mdi margins and sales volumes and the prior year planned po/mtbe maintenance outage of approximately
$90 million. 







performance products  

the decrease in revenues in our performance products segment for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower average selling prices and
lower sales volumes. average selling prices decreased primarily in response to lower raw material costs and competitive market conditions. sales volumes decreased primarily due to competitive market
conditions, softer demand in china and oilfield applications as well as the impact of weather related and other production outages. the decrease in segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower
sales volumes, lower margins in our amines, maleic anhydride and upstream intermediates businesses as well as the impact of weather related and other production outages estimated at approximately
$15 million.

table of contents







advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower sales volumes and lower average selling
prices. sales volumes decreased primarily in the americas region, due to competitive pressure and soft demand. average selling prices decreased in our asia pacific and european regions primarily due
to price concessions in our electrical, electronic and wind markets and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major international currencies. the increase in segment
adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower fixed costs, partially offset by lower margins as savings from lower raw material costs were offset by lower sales volumes and lower selling prices. 







textile effects  

the decrease in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by
higher sales volumes. average selling prices decreased primarily due to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major international
currencies. sales volumes increased in key target countries, mainly in south asia. the increase in segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher margins from lower raw material costs and lower
selling, general and administrative costs. 







pigments and additives  

the decrease in revenues in our pigments and additives segment for 2016 compared to 2015 was due to lower average selling prices, partially
offset by higher sales volumes. average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of competitive pressure and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar primarily against the
euro. sales volumes increased primarily due to increased end use demand for our titanium dioxide, functional additives and timber treatment products. the increase in segment adjusted ebitda was
primarily due to higher margins resulting from restructuring savings. 







corporate and other  

corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, lifo inventory valuation reserve
adjustments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unallocated restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, nonoperating income and expense, benzene sales and gains and losses on the disposition

$151 million for the same period in 2015. the decrease in adjusted ebitda from corporate and other resulted primarily from an increase in lifo inventory valuation expense, partially offset by
an increase in gain from benzene sales.

huntsman
corporation and the decrease of $241 million in net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



• revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased by $1,279 million, or 11%, as compared with 2014. the decrease was due
principally to lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices in all our segments. see "—segment analysis" below. 
• our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased by $71 million and
$75 million, respectively, or 4% each, as compared with 2014. the impact on gross profit resulted from lower gross margins in all of our segments, except for our advanced materials segment. see
"—segment analysis" below. 
• our operating expenses and the operating expenses of huntsman international increased by $10 million each or 1% each, for the year ended
december 31, 2015 as compared with 2014, primarily related to the consolidated expenses of the acquired rockwood businesses, offset in part by the foreign currency exchange impacts of the
strengthening u.s. dollar against other major international currencies. 
• restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to $302 million from
$158 million in 2014. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to $31 million from $28 million in
2014. during 2015, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million related to the redemption of our 2021 senior subordinated notes. for more information, see "note 15.
debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• our income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased to $46 million from $51 million in 2014. the income
tax expense of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased to $45 million from $43 million in 2014. the change in income tax expense is impacted by the
benefit in 2015 of generating $14 million of excess u.s. foreign tax credits and in 2014 of utilizing u.s. foreign tax credits which had been subject to a valuation allowance. excluding the
impact of the u.s. foreign tax credits, our income tax expense and the income tax expense of huntsman international decreased by $97 million and $101 million, respectively, as compared
with 2014, primarily due to lower pre-tax income and tax impacts of tax only foreign currency exchange losses. our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax
jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. for further information concerning taxes, see "note 19. income taxes" to our
consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the decrease in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a planned maintenance outage at our po/mtbe
facility in port neches, texas that commenced in the first quarter of 2015 and extended into the second quarter of 2015, lower mdi average selling prices and the foreign currency exchange impact of a
stronger u.s. dollar against other key currencies. po/mtbe sales volumes decreased due to the planned maintenance outage at our po/mtbe facility in port neches, texas. mdi sales volumes decreased
slightly due to the market slowdown in china and lower sales into commercial construction in the u.s. po/mtbe average selling prices decreased following lower pricing for high octane gasoline. mdi
average selling prices decreased in response to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major european currencies. the decrease in segment
adjusted ebitda was due to lower po/mtbe earnings and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against the euro. we estimate the reduction to segment adjusted ebitda resulting
from the planned po/mtbe maintenance outage was approximately $90 million for 2015. 







performance products  

the decrease in revenues in our performance products segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower average selling prices and
lower sales volumes. average selling prices decreased across all product lines primarily in response to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar
against major european currencies. sales volumes decreased across most product lines, including the effect of the sale of our european commodity surfactants business in the second quarter of 2014
partially offset by higher toll volumes in our upstream intermediates business. the decrease in segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower margins on produced ethylene, partially offset by
higher amines margins. 







advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower sales volumes and lower average selling
prices. sales volumes decreased globally primarily in our coatings and construction and transportation and industrial markets due to the de-selection of certain business and competitive pressure,
partially offset by strong volume growth in our do-it-yourself and wind markets in the asia pacific region. average selling prices increased, in most markets, on a local currency basis in the americas
and asia pacific regions due to certain price increase initiatives

table of contents

and
our focus on higher value markets; overall this was more than offset by the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major international currencies. the increase in
segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher margins, resulting from lower raw material costs, and our focus on higher value business as well as lower fixed costs. 







textile effects  

the decrease in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower average selling prices and lower sales
volumes. average selling prices decreased in response to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major international currencies. sales
volumes decreased primarily due to the de-selection of certain less profitable business and challenging market conditions. the increase in segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower fixed
costs, partially offset by lower margins. 







pigments and additives  

the increase in revenues in our pigments and additives segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the impact of the rockwood
acquisition. other than the impact of the rockwood acquisition, average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of high titanium dioxide industry inventory levels and the foreign currency
exchange impact of a stronger u.s. dollar against major european currencies. sales volumes decreased primarily as a result of lower end-use demand and the impact of a nitrogen tank explosion owned and
operated by a third party at our uerdingen, germany facility, which disrupted our manufacturing during the third quarter of 2015. the decrease in segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower
contribution margin for titanium dioxide and the negative impact from the manufacturing disruption at our uerdingen, germany facility. 







corporate and other  

corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, lifo inventory valuation reserve
adjustments, nonoperating income and expense, benzene sales and gains and losses on the disposition of corporate assets. for 2015, adjusted ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman corporation
increased by $32 million to a loss of $156 million from a loss of $188 million for 2014. for 2015, adjusted ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman international increased by
$31 million to a loss of $151 million from a loss of $182 million for 2014. the increase in adjusted ebitda from corporate and other resulted primarily from an increase in lifo
inventory valuation income and a decrease in unallocated corporate overhead, partially offset by an increase in loss from benzene sales. 







liquidity and capital resources  

the following is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources and generally does not include separate information with respect to
huntsman international in accordance with general instruction i of form 10-k. 







cash flows for year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015  

net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 and 2015 was $1,088 million and $575 million, respectively. the increase in net
cash provided by operating activities during 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily attributable to increased operating income as described in "—results of operations" above as well as a
$473 million favorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2016 as compared with 2015.

table of contents 

net cash used in investing activities for 2016 and 2015 was $202 million and $600 million, respectively. during 2016 and 2015, we paid
$421 million and $663 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. during 2016 and 2015, we made investments in lpc of $29 million and $42 million, respectively,
and in our basf huntsman shanghai isocyanate investment b.v. joint venture of nil and $12 million, respectively, and received dividends from lpc of $33 million and
$48 million, respectively. during 2016 and 2015, we paid nil and $14 million, respectively, for the acquisition of businesses and received proceeds from a purchase price adjustment of
nil and $18 million, respectively, related to the rockwood acquisition. during 2016 and 2015, we received proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of $208 million and
$1 million, respectively, including proceeds of $199 million from the sale of our european surfactants business during 2016. during 2015, we received $66 million from the
termination of cross-currency interest rate contracts. 

net
cash used in financing activities for 2016 and 2015 was $723 million and $562 million, respectively. the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily
due to an increase in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period. on
april 1, 2016, we entered into our 2016 term loan b facility due 2023 ("2016 term loan b") in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million. additionally, on april 1, 2016, we
used the net proceeds of the 2016 term loan b to repay in full our extended term loan b due 2017, extended term loan b—series 2 due 2017 and our term
loan c. on both july 22, 2016 and september 30, 2016, we prepaid $100 million of our 2015 extended term loan b. on december 30, 2016, we made an early repayment of
$260 million on our 2015 extended term loan b using proceeds from the sale of our european surfactants business and existing cash. on march 31, 2015, we issued
€300 million (approximately $326 million) aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2025 ("2025 senior notes"). on april 17, 2015,
we used the net proceeds of this offering to redeem $289 million ($294 million carrying value) of our 2021 senior subordinated notes and redeemed the remaining $195 million
($198 million carrying value) of our 2021 senior subordinated notes during the third quarter of 2015. during 2015, we repurchased $100 million of our common stock. 

free
cash flow for 2016 and 2015 were cash proceeds of $686 million and use of cash of $30 million, respectively. the improvement in free cash flow was attributable to the
changes in cash flows from operating and investing activities, excluding merger and acquisition activities. 







cash flows for year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014  

net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 and 2014 was $575 million and $760 million, respectively. the decrease in net
cash provided by operating activities during 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily attributable to lower net income as described in "—results of operations" above and a $24 million
unfavorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2015 as compared with 2014. 


net
cash used in investing activities for 2015 and 2014 was $600 million and $1,606 million, respectively. during 2015 and 2014, we paid $663 million and
$601 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. during 2014, we paid $1.04 billion for the rockwood acquisition, and during 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from a purchase
price adjustment of $18 million and nil, respectively, related to the rockwood acquisition. for further information, see "note 3. business combinations and dispositions" to our
consolidated financial statements. during 2015 and 2014, we made investments in lpc of $42 million and $37 million, respectively, in nanjing jinling huntsman new
materials co., ltd. of nil and $62 million, respectively, and in our basf huntsman shanghai isocyanate investment b.v. joint venture of $12 million and
$9 million, respectively, and we received dividends from lpc of $48 million each. during 2015 and 2014, we received $1 million and $15 million, respectively, from
the sale of businesses and assets. during 2015 and 2014, we received $66 million and nil, respectively, from the termination of cross-currency interest rate contracts.

table of contents

net
cash (used in) provided by financing activities for 2015 and 2014 was $(562) million and $1,197 million, respectively. the decrease in net cash provided by financing
activities was primarily due to higher net borrowings during 2014, primarily used to fund the rockwood acquisition and an increase in repayments of long-term debt in 2015. on march 31, 2015, we
issued €300 million (approximately $326 million) aggregate principal amount of our 2025 senior notes. on april 17, 2015, we used the net proceeds of this offering

flows.

prefunded during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
• accrued liabilities decreased by $70 million primarily due to the distribution of prefunded restructuring costs.  
• current portion of debt decreased by $110 million primarily due to the repayment of $50 million our term loan c during the second

program"), european accounts receivable securitization program ("eu a/r program" and collectively with the u.s. a/r program, "a/r programs") and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our
operations and working capital needs. as of december 31, 2016, we had $1,208 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity, consisting of $425 million in cash and
restricted cash, $628 million in availability under our revolving facility ("revolving facility"), and $155 million in availability under our a/r programs. our liquidity can be

table of contents

significantly
impacted by various factors. the following matters had, or are expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity:



• cash from our accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable, increased by approximately $304 million for 2016, as reflected
in our consolidated statements of cash flows. we expect volatility in our working capital components to continue. 
• during 2017, we expect to spend approximately $400 million on capital expenditures. our future expenditures include certain ehs
maintenance and upgrades, and periodic maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities. we expect to fund this spending with cash provided by operations.  
• during 2016, we made contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans of $74 million. during 2017, we expect to contribute
an additional amount of approximately $116 million to these plans. 
• we are involved in a number of cost reduction programs for which we have established restructuring accruals. as of december 31, 2016, we
had $89 million of accrued restructuring costs from continuing operations, of which $43 million is classified as current. for further discussion of these plans and the costs involved,
see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 




further,
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges for recently identified plans for business improvements in our pigments and additives segment expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
we expect these additional business improvements to provide additional contributions to adjusted ebitda beginning in 2017. 



• the payment of dividends is a business decision made by our board of directors from time to time based on our earnings, financial position and
prospects, and such other considerations as our board of directors considers relevant. historically, our board of directors has declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per share of common stock.
while management currently expects that the company will continue to pay the quarterly cash dividend, its dividend practice may change at any time. 
• in connection with the sale of our european surfactants business, we recognized a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2016 of
$98 million which was reflected in other operating income, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. for more information, see "note 3. business combination
and dispositions—sale of european surfactants manufacturing facilities" to our consolidated financial statements. 
• on december 30, 2016, we made an early repayment of $260 million on our 2015 extended term loan b using proceeds from the sale of
the european surfactants business and existing cash. see "note 15. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—amendment to the credit agreement." 


on
both july 22, 2016 and september 30, 2016, huntsman international prepaid $100 million of the 2015 extended term loan b. in connection with the $200 million prepayments
on our term loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. see
"note 15. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—senior credit facilities" to our consolidated financial statements. 



• in connection with the proposed spin-off of our pigments and additives business into a separate, publicly traded company, venator, we
anticipate that venator will enter into new financing arrangements in anticipation of the spin-off. after venator has entered into its new financing arrangements but immediately prior to separation,
it will make a cash distribution to huntsman international and, at separation, venator will assume various huntsman international 

80




 


table of contents




indebtedness.
we anticipate that venator will fund such cash distribution and will repay such assumed indebtedness with the proceeds of its new financing arrangement. 



• during 2017, we expect to spend approximately $100 million of non-recurring costs related to the proposed spin-off of our pigments and
additives business, including costs for capital expenditures and financing. for more information see "note 4. separation of pigments and additives business" to our consolidated financial
statements. 
• on november 18, 2016, we entered into a new $350 million term loan b facility due 2021 ("2021 term loan b") and a new
$1,375 million term loan b facility due 2023 ("2023 term loan b"). proceeds from the new term loans were used to repay in full our 2014 term loan b facility due 2021 ("2014 term loan b") and
our 2016 term loan b. as a result of this refinancing, we extended $829 million of term loan maturities from 2021 to 2023 and did not increase our overall indebtedness.  
• on january 30, 2017, our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in pori, finland experienced fire damage and is currently not
operational. we do not currently have an estimated time frame for how long the facility will be off line, but we are committed to repairing the facility as quickly as possible. the pori facility has a
nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons, which represents approximately 15% of our total titanium dioxide capacity and approximately 10% of total european titanium dioxide demand. the site is
insured for property damage as well as business interruption losses. according to our insurance policies, the respective retention levels (deductibles) for physical damage and business interruption
are $15 million and 60 days, respectively. on february 9, 2017, we received a €50 million (approximately $52 million) payment from our insurer as an
initial partial progress payment towards the overall pending claim. 
• during 2017 we expect to receive a cash benefit of approximately $90 million related to overpayments of prior year tax payments. we
expect to receive this refund in the first half of 2017. 


as
of december 31, 2016, we had $60 million classified as current portion of debt, scheduled senior credit facilities amortization payments totaling $18 million,
debt at our variable interest entities of $14 million, and certain other short-term facilities and scheduled amortization payments totaling $28 million. although we cannot provide
assurances, we intend to renew, repay or extend the majority of these short-term facilities in the next twelve months. 


as
of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $383 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries, including our variable
interest entities. additionally, we have material intercompany debt obligations owed to us by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we intend to use cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to fund our local
operations. nevertheless, we could repatriate cash as dividends or as repayments of intercompany debt. if foreign cash were repatriated as dividends, the dividends could be subject to u.s. federal and
state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief. at present, we estimate that we will generate sufficient cash in our u.s. operations, together with the payments of intercompany
debt if necessary, to meet our cash needs in the u.s and we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. as dividends. cash held by certain foreign subsidiaries, including our variable interest
entities, may also be subject to changing monetary policies of governments, legal restrictions, including those arising from the interests of our partners, which could limit the amounts available for
repatriation. 







capital resources  


we are now commissioning a new production facility in augusta, georgia for the synthesis of iron oxide pigments, which we purchased from
rockwood. during commissioning, the facility has 

81




 

table of contents

experienced
delays producing products at the expected specifications and quantities, causing us to question the capabilities of the augusta technology. based on the facility's performance during the
commissioning process, we have concluded that production capacity at our augusta facility will be substantially lower than originally anticipated. on february 6, 2017, we filed a lawsuit
against rockwood, albemarle corporation (as rockwood's successor) and certain former rockwood executives to recover damage for fraud and breach of contract involving the augusta technology.

minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $2 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases.
(3)we
have various purchase commitments extending through 2029 for materials, supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. included in the
purchase commitments table above are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2017. certain contracts allow for
changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period, such notice period has been
included in the above table. the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations. we have estimated our
contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased. we
believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made minimum payments of $2 million, nil
and nil, respectively, under such take or pay contracts without taking the product.

restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs

since
the rockwood acquisition, our pigments and additives segment has been involved in a cost reduction program expected to reduce costs by approximately
$140 million and improve its global competitiveness. in addition, we have announced a capacity reduction at our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in calais, france expected to generate
approximately $35 million of annual savings. the cost savings from this cost reduction program were achieved during the first half of 2016. further, we expect to incur additional restructuring
charges for recently identified plans for business improvements in our pigments and additives segment expected to be completed by the end of 2018. we expect these additional business improvements to
provide additional contributions to adjusted ebitda beginning in 2017. 

for
further discussion of these and other restructuring plans and the costs involved, see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated
financial statements. 







legal proceedings

for
a discussion of legal proceedings, see "note 20. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 







environmental, health and safety matters

as
noted above in "part i. item 1. business—environmental, health and safety matters" and "part i. item 1a. risk factors," we
are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. while we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a
material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition. for a discussion of environmental,
health and safety matters, see "note 21. environmental, health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 







recently issued accounting pronouncements


for
a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies—recently issued accounting
pronouncements" to our consolidated financial statements. 







critical accounting policies

the
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. our significant accounting policies are
summarized in "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements. summarized below are our critical accounting policies: 







employee benefit programs  

we sponsor several contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans, covering employees primarily in the u.s., the u.k., the netherlands,
belgium and switzerland, but also covering employees in a number of other countries. we fund the material plans through trust arrangements (or local equivalents) where the assets are held separately
from us. we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the u.s., canada and south africa. amounts
recorded in our consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries. inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions
regarding expected long-term rates of return on 

83




 

table of contents

plan
assets, discount rates, compensation increases, mortality rates and health care cost trends. these assumptions are described in "note 18. employee benefit plans" to our consolidated
financial statements. 

management,
with the advice of actuaries, uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based. the effect
of a 1% change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

goodwill  

we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. approximately 69% of
our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit. the remaining goodwill relates to three other reporting units. 


fair
value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. the estimated fair values of our reporting units are
dependent on several significant assumptions including, among others, market information, operating results, earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows. 

we
tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2016 as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
our most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amounts of all reporting units by a significant margin. 







income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed
on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each
jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or
losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective 

84




 

table of contents

evidence
such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. as of
december 31, 2016, we had total valuation allowances of $757 million. see "note 19. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our
valuation allowances. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that are reinvested
and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. we have material intercompany debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation, combined with the ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of intercompany debt owed by
our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend we will utilize our intercompany debt. if any earnings
were repatriated via dividend, we may need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. as discussed in "note 19. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements, we made a distribution
of a portion of our earnings in 2015 when the amount of foreign tax credits associated with the distribution was greater than the amount of tax otherwise due. the undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries with positive earnings that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately $390 million at december 31, 2016. it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized
deferred tax liability on those earnings because of the significant assumptions necessary to compute the tax. 


accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to be
realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and
the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in order to measure
the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing
authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized
in our consolidated financial statements. 







long-lived assets  

the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience, engineering estimates and industry
information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets. the estimated lives of our property range from 3 to 50 years and
depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method. inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will
be performed. without on-going capital improvements and maintenance, the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter. 

management
uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. at december 31, 2016, if the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment had either
been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives, then depreciation expense for 2016 would have been approximately $35 million less or $41 million greater, respectively. 

we
are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or
when 

85




 

table of contents

management's
plans change regarding those assets, such as idling or closing a plant. we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values. key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life, technology, competitive pressures, raw
material pricing and regulations. in connection with our asset evaluation policy, we reviewed all of our long-lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. during 2016,
we recorded an impairment charge of $1 million related to the impairment of our pigments and additives south african asset group. see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant
closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







restructuring and plant closing costs  

we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations, workforce reductions and other cost
savings programs in each of our business segments. these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan. estimates for plant closing costs
include the write-off of the carrying value of the plant, any necessary environmental and/or regulatory costs, contract termination and demolition costs. estimates for workforce reductions and other
costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated, termination benefits to be provided and other information, as necessary. management evaluates the estimates
on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the currently recorded estimate. for further discussion of our restructuring activities,
see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 








contingent loss accruals  

environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation, available technology, site-specific information and remediation alternatives. we accrue an amount
equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information. the extent of environmental impacts may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation may
change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available, technology that can
be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage. adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses. for further
information, see "note 21. environmental, health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 

we
are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of
probable losses. a determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. we have an active risk management program
consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. these policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. the
required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. for further information, see "note 20. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our
consolidated financial statements.  

 
item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk        

we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. from time to time, we enter into
transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in 

86




 

table of contents

certain
european operations. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 







interest rate risks

through
our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio, including the mix of fixed and
floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as well as entering into interest rate
derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate long-term debt. under
interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount. 

huntsman
international has entered into several interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our
senior credit facilities. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had $100 million notional value of interest rate hedges with a fixed rate of 2.5%. these swaps are
designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive loss. the fair value of these hedges on december 31,
2016 and december 31, 2015 was $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and was recorded as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
these hedges will expire in april 2017. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with these cash flow hedging activities
were gains of approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively. 

beginning
in 2009, aac entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed payment of 5.02%. in connection with
the consolidation of aac as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 8. variable interest entities" to our consolidated
financial statements. the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2016 was $18 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. as of
december 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the swap was $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and was recorded as other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance
sheets. for 2016 and 2015, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of $1 million each due to changes in fair value of the swap. 

during
2017, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 







foreign exchange rate risk

our
cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies. we enter into
foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries
to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally through the purchase of spot or
forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates
on our cash flows and earnings. as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately $176 million notional 

87




 

table of contents

amount
(in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed u.s. dollar payments of $5 million semiannually on may 15 and november 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately €3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). as of december 31, 2016, the fair value of this swap was $29 million and
was recorded in noncurrent assets. 

in
march 2010, we entered into three five year cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional $350 million for an aggregate notional
€255 million. this swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. during the three months ended march 31, 2015, we terminated these
cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $66 million in payments from the counterparties. 


a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges.

currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2016, we have designated
approximately €651 million (approximately $677 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. for the
years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the amount of gain recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $27 million, $68 million and $97 million, respectively, and was
recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. 







commodity prices risk

inherent
in our business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. however, our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority
of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly
basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures. for further information, see "note 16. derivative instruments and hedging
activities—commodity prices risk" to our consolidated financial statements.

there have been no changes in our independent accountants, deloitte & touche llp, or disagreements with them on matters of

item 9a.    controls and procedures        







evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act) as of december 31, 2016. based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
have concluded that, as of december 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the exchange act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 







changes in internal control over financial reporting

no
changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act). 







management's report on internal control over financial
reporting

management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control framework and processes for our
company and huntsman international are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management, huntsman
international's board of managers and our board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. 

our
internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international includes those policies and procedures that:



• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of our company and huntsman international; 
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded properly to allow for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company and huntsman international are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of our company and huntsman international; 
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and 
• provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud. 


because
of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. further,
because of changing conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 


our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international and concluded that, as of december 31, 2016,
such internal control is effective. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control—integrated framework (2013) ("coso"). 

our
independent registered public accountants, deloitte & touche llp, with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee, have audited our
consolidated financial statements prepared by our company and huntsman international and have issued attestation reports on internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman
international.

management's process to assess the effectiveness of  internal control over financial reporting

to
comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we completed a comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our internal
control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international. we involved employees at all levels of our company during 2016 in training, performing and evaluating our internal
controls. 

our
management's conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the five elements of coso. our
management considered information from multiple sources as the basis its conclusion—including self-assessments of the control activities within each work process, assessments of
division-level and entity-level controls and internal control attestations from key external service providers, as well as from key management. in addition, our internal control processes contain
self-monitoring mechanisms, and proactive steps are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. we also maintain an internal auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting within each of the five coso elements.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2016, based on criteria established in  internal control—integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the company's
management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on
internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in  internal control—integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. 


we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended december 31, 2016 of the company and our report dated february 15, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
financial statement schedules.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016. our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in
the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. 

we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31,
2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 15, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of managers and members of
huntsman international llc and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016. our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the
index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 

we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries as of
december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 15, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

description of business  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our products comprise a broad range
of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the
adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, digital inks, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power
generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride,
epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. 

we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced
materials and textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces inorganic chemical products. in a series of transactions
beginning in 2006, we sold or shutdown substantially all of our australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations. we report the results of these businesses
as discontinued operations. 







company  

our company, a delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the huntsman businesses. jon m. huntsman founded the predecessor to our
company in 1970 as a small packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses.

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued) 







1. general (continued) 

currently,
we operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in
1999. 







recent developments  

on january 30, 2017, our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in pori, finland experienced fire damage and is currently not
operational. the fire brigade responded quickly to extinguish the fire and there were no injuries. we have notified applicable customers and suppliers of this force
majeure event. we do not currently have an estimated time frame for how long the facility will be off line, but we are committed to repairing the facility as quickly as
possible. the pori facility has a nameplate capacity of 130,000 metric tons, which represents approximately 15% of our total titanium dioxide capacity and approximately 10% of total european titanium
dioxide demand. the site is insured for property damage as well as business interruption losses. according to our insurance policies, the respective retention levels (deductibles) for physical damage
and business interruption are $15 million and 60 days, respectively. on february 9, 2017, we received a €50 million (approximately $52 million) payment from
our insurer as an initial partial progress payment towards the overall pending claim. 


on
october 28, 2016, we filed an initial form 10 registration statement with the sec as part of the process to spin off our pigments and additives and textile effects
businesses in a tax-free transaction. on january 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our textile effects business and we amended the form 10 registration statement. for further
information, see "note 4. separation of pigments and additives business." 

on
december 30, 2016, our performance products segment completed the sale of its european surfactants business to innospec inc. for $199 million in cash plus our
retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. for further information, see "note 3. business combinations and dispositions—sale of
european surfactants manufacturing facilities." 

on
december 30, 2016, we made an early repayment of $260 million on our 2015 extended term loan b using proceeds from the sale of the european surfactants business
and existing cash. for further information, see "note 15. direct and subsidiary debt—senior credit facilities." 







huntsman corporation and huntsman international financial statements  

except where otherwise indicated, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both our company and huntsman international.
the differences between our consolidated financial statements and huntsman international's consolidated financial statements relate primarily to the
following:



• purchase accounting recorded at our company for the 2003 step-acquisition of huntsman international holdings llc, the former parent
company of huntsman international that was merged into huntsman international in 2005; 
• the different capital structures; and 
• a note payable from huntsman international to us.

2. summary of significant accounting policies  







asset retirement obligations  

we accrue for asset retirement obligations, which consist primarily of landfill capping, closure and post-closure costs, asbestos abatement
costs, demolition and removal costs and leasehold remediation costs, in the period in which the obligations are incurred. asset retirement obligations are accrued at estimated fair value. when the
liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. over time, the liability is accreted to its estimated settlement value and
the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and
the liability recorded. 







carrying value of long-lived assets  

we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability is based upon current and anticipated undiscounted cash flows, and we recognize an impairment when such estimated cash flows are
less than the carrying value of the asset. measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between carrying value and fair value. fair value is generally estimated by
discounting estimated future cash flows using a
discount rate commensurate with the risks involved or selling price of assets held for sale. see "note 12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs." 







cash and cash equivalents  

we consider cash in checking accounts and cash in short-term highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase, to be cash and cash equivalents. cash flows from discontinued operations are not presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows. 







cost of goods sold  

we classify the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products as cost of goods sold. manufacturing costs include variable costs,
primarily raw materials and energy, and fixed expenses directly associated with production. manufacturing costs also include, among other things, plant site operating costs and overhead (including
depreciation), production planning and logistics costs, repair and maintenance costs, plant site purchasing costs, and engineering and technical support costs. distribution, freight and warehousing
costs are also included in cost of goods sold. 







derivatives and hedging activities  

all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. if the derivative is
designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the
fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain

international
operations are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent effective. the effectiveness of a cash flow hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge,
and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three months. a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is determined to be effective if the change in value of the hedge
divided by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of 80% to 125%. hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging
instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction. for a derivative that does not qualify or has not been designated as a hedge, changes in fair
value are recognized in earnings. 







environmental expenditures  

environmental related restoration and remediation costs are recorded as liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation and
clean-up obligations are either known or considered probable and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. other environmental expenditures that are principally maintenance or preventative in
nature are recorded when expended and incurred and are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. see "note 21. environmental, health and safety matters." 







foreign currency translation  

the accounts of our operating subsidiaries outside of the u.s., unless they are operating in highly inflationary economic environments, consider
the functional currency to be the currency of the economic environment in which they operate. accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at a weighted average rate for the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded to equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss. 

if
a subsidiary operates in an economic environment that is considered to be highly inflationary (100% cumulative inflation over a three-year period), the u.s. dollar is considered to be
the functional currency and gains and losses from remeasurement to the u.s. dollar from the local currency are included in the statement of operations. where a subsidiary's operations are effectively
run, managed,
financed and contracted in u.s. dollars, such as certain finance subsidiaries outside of the u.s., the u.s. dollar is considered to be the functional currency. 


foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations and were net (gains) losses of $(5) million,
$7 million and $15 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 







income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be
realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of
the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

conclusions
require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the
applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in
applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. 

we
do not provide for income taxes or benefits on the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be
reinvested indefinitely. 

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to be
realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and
the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we
are required to make judgments and apply assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be
realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in
assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements. 







intangible assets and goodwill  


intangible assets are stated at cost (fair value at the time of acquisition) and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives or the life of the related agreement as follows: 
 

 
 












patents and technology
 
 
5 - 30 years
 


trademarks
 
 
9 - 30 years
 


licenses and other agreements
 
 
5 - 15 years
 


other intangibles
 
 
5 - 15 years
 



 
goodwill
represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not subject to any method of amortization, but is tested for
impairment annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related reporting unit, we are required to reduce the amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings. fair value is estimated using
the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. the net change in
goodwill during 2016 of $5 million was due to the addition of goodwill of approximately $5 million from the finalization of the accounting for an acquisition, partially offset by less
than $1 million of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

inventories  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using lifo, first-in first-out, and average costs methods for
different components of inventory. 







legal costs  

we expense legal costs, including those legal costs incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. 







net income per share attributable to huntsman corporation  

basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to huntsman corporation common stockholders by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. diluted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing net
income available to huntsman corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been
outstanding as dilutive securities. 

basic

the effect would be anti-dilutive. 







other noncurrent assets  

other noncurrent assets consist primarily of capitalized turnover costs, spare parts, deposits, catalyst assets and investments in
available-for-sale securities.

principles of consolidation  

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and any variable interest
entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 







property, plant and equipment  


property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives or lease term as follows: 
 

 
 












buildings and equipment
 
 
5 - 50 years
 


plant and equipment
 
 
3 - 30 years
 


furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements
 
 
5 - 20 years
 



 
interest
expense capitalized as part of plant and equipment was $18 million, $22 million and $16 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. 

periodic
maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities (a "turnaround") are accounted for on the deferral basis by capitalizing the costs of the
turnaround within noncurrent assets and amortizing the costs over the estimated period until the next turnaround. normal maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as
incurred. renewals, betterments and major repairs that materially extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized, and the assets replaced, if any, are retired. 







revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we recognize revenue when it is
realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, collectability is reasonably assured
and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 







securitization of accounts receivable  

under our a/r programs, we grant an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables to a u.s. special purpose entity ("u.s. spe") and a
european special purpose entity ("eu spe"). this undivided interest serves as security for the issuance of debt. the a/r programs provide for financing in both u.s. dollars and euros. the amounts
outstanding under our a/r programs are accounted for as secured borrowings. see "note 15. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—a/r programs." 







stock-based compensation  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the
award. that cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. see "note 23. stock-based compensation plan."

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 







use of estimates  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. actual results could differ from those estimates. 







recently issued accounting pronouncements  







accounting pronouncements adopted during 2016  

in january 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2015-01,  income
statement—extraordinary and unusual items (subtopic 225-20): simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary
items, eliminating from u.s. gaap the concept of extraordinary items. reporting entities will no longer have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is
extraordinary. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. we adopted the amendments in this asu
effective january 1, 2016, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
february 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis. the
amendments in this asu change the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when
determining a controlling financial interest. these amendments affect areas specific to limited partnerships and similar legal entities, evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or service provider as
a variable interest, the effects of both fee arrangements and related parties on the primary beneficiary determination and certain investment funds. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective january 1, 2016, and the initial adoption of the
amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


in
april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-05, intangibles—goodwill and other—internal-use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's
accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. the amendments in this asu provide guidance that will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a
customer in a cloud computing arrangement, including whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer
should account for the software license consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses; otherwise, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. the amendments in
this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective january 1,
2016, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 







accounting pronouncements pending adoption in future periods  

in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers
(topic 606), outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

arising
from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts
with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, deferring the effective date of asu no. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. further, in march 2016,
the fasb issued asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus
net), clarifying the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, in april 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-10, revenue
from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing, clarifying the implementation guidance on identifying performance
obligations in a contract and determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a
point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time), in may 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-12, revenue from
customers (topic 606): narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients, providing clarifications and practical expedients for certain narrow aspects in
topic 606, and in december 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-20, technical corrections and improvements to topic 606, revenue from contracts with
customers. the amendments in these asus are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
period. the amendments in asu no. 2014-09, asu no. 2016-08, asu no. 2016-10, asu no. 2016-12 and asu no. 2016-20 should be applied retrospectively, and early
application is permitted. we are currently performing the analysis identifying areas that will be impacted by the adoption of the amendments in asu no. 2014-09, asu no. 2016-08, asu
no. 2016-10, asu no. 2016-12 and asu no. 2016-20 on our consolidated financial statements. at this time, we believe the key impact of the standard will be on our accounting for
revenues from intellectual property licensing contracts which is not a material revenue stream to our consolidated financial statements. the standard will be adopted in our fiscal year 2018 and we
have not yet determined the transition method. 

in
july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, inventory (topic 330): simplifying the measurement of inventory. the amendments in
this asu do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in first-out ("lifo") or the retail inventory method, but rather does apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is
measured using first-in first-out or average cost. an entity should measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in
the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using lifo or the retail
inventory method. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016. the amendments in this asu should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning
of an interim or annual reporting period. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842). the amendments in this asu will increase transparency and
comparability among entities by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. the amendments in this asu will require
lessees to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and

interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2018. early application of the amendments in this asu is permitted for all entities. reporting entities are required to
recognize and measure leases under these amendments at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
the amendments in this asu on our consolidated financial statements and believe, based on our preliminary assessment, that we will record significant additional right-to-use assets and lease
obligations. 

in
march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, compensation—stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based
payment accounting. the amendments in this asu simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption of the amendments in this asu is permitted in any interim or annual period. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in
this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
august 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-15, statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash
payments. the amendments in this asu clarify and include specific guidance to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in
the statement of cash flows. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. the amendments in this asu should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. we do not expect the adoption of the
amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than
inventory. the amendments in this asu require entities to recognize the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the
transfer occurs, as opposed to deferring the recognition of the income tax consequences until the asset has been sold to an outside party. the amendments in this asu are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after december 31, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an
annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. the amendments in this asu should be applied on a modified retrospective
basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  

in
november 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash. the amendments in
this asu require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents. therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and
end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim period within those
fiscal years. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. the amendments in this asu should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. we do
not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-01,  business combinations (topic 805):
clarifying the definition of a business. the amendments in this asu clarify the definition of a business with
the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. the amendments in this asu are
effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early application is permitted. the amendments in this asu should be applied
prospectively on or after the effective date. no disclosures are required at transition. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

in
january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-04, intangibles—goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill
impairment. the amendments in this asu simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. under the amendments in
this asu, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, which eliminates the current requirement to
calculate a goodwill impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount. the amendments in this asu are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment
tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1, 2017. the
amendments in this asu should be applied on a prospective basis. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

sale of european surfactants manufacturing facilities  

on december 30, 2016, our performance products segment completed the sale of its european surfactants business to innospec inc.
for $199 million in cash plus our retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. under the terms of the transaction, innospec acquired our
manufacturing facilities located in saint-mihiel, france; castiglione delle stiviere, italy; and barcelona, spain. the purchase price is subject to the finalization of working capital adjustments. we
remain committed to our global surfactants business, including in the u.s. and australia, where our differentiated surfactants businesses are backward integrated into essential feedstocks. upon
closing the transaction, we entered into supply and long-term tolling arrangements with innospec in order to continue marketing certain core products strategic to our global agrochemicals, lubes and

businesses.
in connection with this sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $98 million which was reflected in other operating income, net on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. 







rockwood acquisition  

on october 1, 2014, we completed the rockwood acquisition. we paid $1.02 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded pension
liabilities in connection with the rockwood acquisition. the acquisition was financed using a bank term loan. the majority of the acquired businesses have been integrated into our pigments and
additives segment. transaction costs charged to expense related to this acquisition were approximately nil, nil and $24 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 

the
following businesses were acquired from rockwood:



• titanium dioxide, a white pigment derived from titanium bearing ores with strong specialty business in fibers, inks, pharmaceuticals, food and
cosmetics; 
• functional additives made from barium and zinc based inorganics used to make colors more brilliant, primarily in plastics, coatings, films,
food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and paper; 
• color pigments made from synthetic iron-oxide and other non-tio2 inorganic pigments used by manufacturers of coatings and colorants;  
• timber treatment wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications;

in
connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the rockwood acquisition, we sold our tio2 tr52 product line used in printing inks to henan in december
2014. the sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply tr52 product to henan during a transitional period.

during
the second quarter of 2015, we received $18 million related to the settlement of certain purchase price adjustments. as a result of the finalization of the valuation of the
assets and liabilities, reallocations were made in certain property, plant and equipment, deferred tax, accrued liability and other long-term liability balances. none of the fair value of this
acquisition was allocated to goodwill. intangible assets acquired consist primarily of developed technology, trademarks and customer relationships, all of which are being amortized over nine years.
the noncontrolling interest primarily relates to viance, a 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical acquired as part of the rockwood acquisition. the noncontrolling interest was valued at 50% of the
fair value of the net assets of viance as of october 1, 2014, as dictated by the ownership interest percentages. if the rockwood acquisition were to have occurred on january 1, 2014, the
following estimated pro forma revenues and net income

4. separation of pigments and additives business  


on october 28, 2016, we filed an initial form 10 registration statement with the sec as part of the process to spin off our pigments and additives and textile effects
businesses in a tax-free transaction. on january 17, 2017, we announced that we will retain our textile effects business and we amended the form 10 registration statement. we also
announced that the name of the spin-off entity will be venator materials corporation. venator shares are expected to trade on the new york stock exchange under the ticker vntr after the distribution
to our stockholders. the completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the registration statement on form 10 for venator's common
stock being declared effective by the sec and certain other conditions described in the information statement included in the form 10. the ongoing process to separate the pigments and additives
business is proceeding and is targeted for the second quarter 2017. as noted in "note 1. general—recent developments" above, there was fire damage sustained at our titanium dioxide
facility in pori, finland. the potential impact of this interruption, if any, on the spin date is not yet known. 


in
connection with this spin-off, we recorded spin-off separation costs of $18 million during 2016, within corporate and other, including $7 million of accrued employee
termination benefit costs and $11 million of other separation costs, of which $8 million was paid during 2016 and $3 million was recorded in accounts payable as of
december 31, 2016 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

7. investment in unconsolidated affiliates (continued) 

in
november 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec (nanjing jingling). the joint venture involves the construction and operation of a po/mtbe
facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51% interest. our total equity investment is anticipated to be approximately
$85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. at the end of 2016, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture.
the facility is expected to be mechanically complete in early 2017 with beneficial commercial operations expected in the second half of 2017. 







8. variable interest entities  


we evaluate our investments and transactions to identify variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. we hold a variable interest in the following joint ventures
for which we are the primary beneficiary:



• rubicon llc is our 50%-owned joint venture with chemtura that manufactures products for our polyurethanes and performance products
segments. the structure of the joint venture is such that the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its activities without additional financial
support. by virtue of the operating agreement with this joint venture, we purchase a majority of the output, absorb a majority of the operating costs and provide a majority of the additional funding.  
• pacific iron products sdn bhd is our 50%-owned joint venture with coogee chemicals that manufactures products for our pigments and additives
segment. in this joint venture we supply all the raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers.
through a fixed price raw materials supply contract with the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. 
• aac is our 50%-owned joint venture with zamil group that manufactures products for our performance products segment. as required in the
operating agreement governing this joint venture, we purchase all of aac's production and sell it to our customers. substantially all of the joint venture's activities are conducted on our behalf.  
• sasol-huntsman is our 50%-owned joint venture with sasol that owns and operates a maleic anhydride facility in moers, germany. this joint
venture manufactures products for our performance products segment. the joint venture uses our technology and expertise, and we bear a disproportionate amount of risk of loss due to a related-party
loan to sasol-huntsman for which we bear the default risk. 
• viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical. viance markets timber treatment products for our pigments and additives segment. our
joint venture interest in viance was acquired as part of the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. the joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement
at our harrisburg, north carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on viance's behalf. as
a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and began consolidating viance upon the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014.

2016 restructuring activities  

in december 2015, our performance products segment announced plans for a reorganization of its commercial and technical functions and a
refocused divisional business strategy to better position the segment for growth in coming years. in addition, a program was launched to capture growth opportunities, improve manufacturing cost
efficiency and reduce inventories. in connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $16 million in 2016. all expected charges have been incurred as of the end
of 2016. 

in
september 2011, we announced plans to implement a significant restructuring of our textile effects segment, including the closure of our production facilities and business support
offices in basel, switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the textile effects segment's long-term global competitiveness (the "textile effects restructuring plan"). in
connection with the textile effects restructuring plan and in connection with revised estimates of site closure costs, during 2016, our textile effects segment recorded charges of $9 million
for non-cancelable long-term contract termination costs and $20 million for decommissioning associated with this initiative.

12. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs (continued) 

in
december 2014, we announced a comprehensive restructuring program to improve the global competitiveness of our pigments and additives segment (the "pigments and additives
restructuring plan"). as part of the pigments and additives restructuring plan, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 900 positions. in connection with the pigments and additives
restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring expense of $3 million in 2016. we expect to incur additional charges of approximately $4 million through the end of 2017. 

in
march 2015, we announced plans to restructure our color pigments business (the "color pigments restructuring plan"), another step in our pigments and additives restructuring plan, and
recorded restructuring expense of approximately $15 million in 2016. we expect to incur additional charges of approximately $10 million through the end of 2017. 

in
july 2016, we announced plans to close our pigments and additives segment's south african titanium dioxide manufacturing facility. as part of the program, we recorded restructuring
expense of approximately $6 million in 2016. additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $1 million during the second quarter of 2016. the majority of the long-lived assets
associated with this manufacturing facility were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2015. we expect to incur additional charges of approximately $5 million through the third quarter of 2018. 

in

direct and subsidiary debt  

huntsman corporation's direct debt and guarantee obligations consist of a guarantee of certain indebtedness incurred from time to time to
finance certain insurance premiums. substantially all of our other debt, including the facilities described below, has been incurred by our subsidiaries (primarily huntsman international); huntsman
corporation is not a guarantor of such subsidiary debt. 

certain
of our subsidiaries are designated as nonguarantor subsidiaries and have third-party debt agreements. these debt agreements contain certain restrictions with regard to dividends,
distributions, loans or advances. in certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to us. 







debt issuance costs  

we record debt issuance costs related to a debt liability on the balance sheet as a reduction in the face amount of that debt liability. as of
december 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of debt issuance costs directly reducing the debt liability was $57 million and $67 million, respectively. we record the amortization of
debt issuance costs as interest expense.

subsidiaries, and pledges of intercompany notes between certain of our subsidiaries.

the
2021 term loan b matures on october 1, 2021 and the 2023 term loan b matures on april 1, 2023, provided that the maturity date will accelerate if we do

repay in full huntsman international's extended term loan b due 2017, our extended term loan b—series 2 due 2017 and our term loan c. in connection with these
repayments, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2 million in the second quarter of 2016. the 2016 term loan b was repaid in full in conjunction with the

accelerate if we do not repay, refinance or have a minimum level of liquidity available to enable us to repay our 2015 extended term
loan b due 2019 or our senior notes upon their maturity. the amendment further increased the committed amount of our revolving facility by $25 million (from $625 million to
$650 million). borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at the same rate as the existing revolving commitments. as of december 31, 2016, we had no borrowings under our

do not guarantee these loan commitments, and aac is not a guarantor of any of our other debt obligations. 







other debt  

on july 24, 2015, hps entered into a financing arrangement to fund the construction of our mdi plant in china. as part of the financing,
hps has secured commitments of a rmb 669 million (approximately $96 million) term loan and a rmb 423 million (approximately $61 million) working capital facility. these
facilities are unsecured, and we do not provide a guarantee of these loan commitments. as of december 31, 2016, we had term loan borrowings of rmb111 million (approximately
$16 million) and no borrowings under the working capital facility. the interest rate on the facilities is 90% of the peoples bank of china rate. as of december 31, 2016, the interest
rate was approximately 4%. 

hps
also has a loan facility for working capital loans and discounting of commercial drafts. during the year 2016, hps has repaid rmb 325 million (approximately
$47 million) of borrowings under this facility. as of december 31, 2016 hps had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. interest is calculated using the peoples bank of china rate
plus the applicable margin. the average all in rate as of december 31, 2016 was approximately 4%. 







note payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation  

as of december 31, 2016, we have a loan of $796 million to our subsidiary, huntsman international. the intercompany note is
unsecured and $100 million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december 31, 2016 on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2016, under the terms
of the intercompany note, huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly average borrowing rate obtained under our
u.s. a/r program, less 10 basis points (provided that the rate shall not exceed

15. debt (continued) 

an
amount that is 25 basis points less than the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the u.s. libor-based borrowings under our revolving facility). 







compliance with covenants  

we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including our
senior credit facilities, our a/r programs and our notes. 

our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable. furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a
failure to comply with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement. 

our
senior credit facilities are the leverage covenant which applies only to the revolving facility and is calculated at the huntsman international level. the leverage covenant is
applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding). the
leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international's ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda (as defined in the applicable agreement) is not
more than 3.75 to 1. 

if
in the future huntsman international fails to comply with the leverage covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility. if huntsman international
failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility, huntsman international would be in default under
the senior credit facilities, and, unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), huntsman international could
be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities. 


the
agreements governing our a/r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. any material failure to meet the applicable a/r programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the a/r programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the a/r programs in full. an early termination event under the a/r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit
facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities.

16. derivative instruments and hedging activities  


we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. from time to time, we enter into transactions, including transactions
involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of
certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 







interest rate risks  

through our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio, including
the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as well as entering
into interest rate derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate long-term debt. under
interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount. 

huntsman
international has entered into several interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our
senior credit facilities. as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had $100 million notional value of interest rate hedges with a fixed rate of 2.5%. these swaps are
designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive loss. the fair value of these hedges on december 31,
2016 and december 31, 2015 was $1 million and
$2 million, respectively, and was recorded as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. these hedges will expire in april 2017. for the years ended december 31, 2016
and 2015, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with these cash flow hedging activities were gains of approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively.

16. derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued) 


beginning
in 2009, aac entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed payment of 5.02%. in connection with
the consolidation of aac as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 8. variable interest entities." the notional amount of the
swap as of december 31, 2016 was $18 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the swap
was $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and was recorded as other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. for 2016 and 2015, we recorded a reduction of interest
expense of $1 million each due to changes in fair value of the swap. 


during
2017, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 







foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in various
currencies. we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash
balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally
through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the
effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. as of both december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately $176 million notional amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents)
outstanding in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed u.s. dollar payments of $5 million semiannually on may 15 and november 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately €3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). as of december 31, 2016, the fair value of this swap was $29 million and
was recorded in noncurrent assets. 

in
march 2010, we entered into three five year cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional $350 million for an aggregate notional
€255 million. this swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. during the three months ended march 31, 2015, we terminated these
cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $66 million in payments from the counterparties.

16. derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued) 

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 


foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2016, we have designated
approximately €651 million (approximately $677 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. for the
years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the amount of gain recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $27 million, $68 million and $97 million, respectively,
and was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. 







commodity prices risk  

inherent in our business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. however, our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat
limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set
on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures.

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract. these
instruments have been categorized by us as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs associated with the credit valuation adjustment, which we deemed to be significant
inputs to the overall measurement of fair value at inception.

we
also have assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets include property, plant and equipment and those
associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill and intangible assets. for these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if one or
more is determined to be impaired. during 2016 and 2015, we recorded charges of $1 million and $19 million, respectively, for the impairment of long-lived assets. see "note 12.
restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs."

18. employee benefit plans  







defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans  

our employees participate in a trusteed, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the "plan") that covers substantially all of our
full-time u.s. employees. effective july 1, 2004, the plan formula for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement was converted to a cash balance design. for represented
employees, participation in the cash balance design is subject to the terms of negotiated contracts. for participating employees, benefits accrued under the prior formula were converted to opening
cash balance accounts. the new cash balance benefit formula provides annual pay credits from 4% to 12% of eligible pay, depending on age and service, plus accrued interest. participants in the plan on
july 1, 2004 may be eligible for additional annual pay credits from 1% to 8%, depending on their age and service as of that date, for up to five years. the conversion to the cash balance plan
did not have a significant impact on the accrued benefit liability, the funded status or ongoing pension expense. 

we
sponsor defined benefit plans in a number of countries outside of the u.s. the availability of these plans, and their specific design provisions, are consistent with local competitive
practices and regulations. 

we
also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, which provide medical and life insurance benefits. 


our
postretirement benefit plans provide a fully insured medicare part d plan including prescription drug benefits affected by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (the "act"). we cannot determine whether the medical benefits provided by our postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to those provided by the act. we do not
collect a subsidy and our net periodic postretirement benefits cost, and related benefit obligation, do not reflect an amount associated with the subsidy. 

beginning
july 1, 2014, the huntsman defined benefit pension plan was closed to new non-union entrants and as of april 1, 2015, it was closed to new union entrants. in
addition, as of january 1, 2015, rubicon llc also closed its defined benefit plan to new entrants. following the closure of these plans, new hires have been provided with a defined

at
both december 31, 2016 and 2015, the health care trend rate used to measure the expected increase in the cost of benefits was assumed to be 7.0%, decreasing to 5% after 2025.
assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. a one-percent point change in assumed health care cost trend rates
would have the following effects (dollars in millions):

our
investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to pursue an investment plan that, over the long term, is expected to protect the funded status of the plan, enhance the real
purchasing power of plan assets, and not threaten the plan's ability to meet currently committed obligations. additionally, our investment strategy is to achieve returns on plan assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk. plan assets are invested in a broad range of investments. these investments are diversified in terms of domestic and international equities, both growth and value
funds, including small, mid and large capitalization equities; short-term and long-term debt securities; real estate; and cash and cash equivalents. the investments are further diversified within each
asset category. the portfolio diversification provides protection against a single investment or asset category having a disproportionate impact on the aggregate performance of the plan assets. 

our
pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers. the investment managers value our plan assets using quoted market prices, other observable inputs or unobservable
inputs. for certain assets, the investment managers obtain third-party appraisals at least annually, which use valuation techniques and inputs specific to the applicable property, market, or
geographic location. during 2016, there were no transfers into or out of level 3 assets.

equity
securities in our pension plans did not include any direct investments in equity securities of our company or our affiliates at the end of 2016. 







defined contribution plans—u.s.

we
have a money purchase pension plan covering substantially all of our domestic employees who were hired prior to january 1, 2004. employer contributions are
made based on a percentage of employees' earnings (ranging up to 8%). during 2014, we closed this plan to non-union participants, continuing to provide equivalent benefits to those covered under this
plan into their salary deferral account. 

we
also have a salary deferral plan covering substantially all u.s. employees. plan participants may elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their
compensation. we contribute an amount equal to one-half of the participant's contribution, not to exceed 2% of the participant's compensation. 

along
with the introduction of the cash balance formula within our defined benefit pension plan, the money purchase pension plan was closed to new hires. at the same time, our match in
the salary deferral plan was increased, for new hires, to a 100% match, not to exceed 4% of the participant's compensation, once the participant has achieved six years of service with our company. 

our
total combined expense for the above defined contribution plans for each of the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $23 million, $23 million and
$15 million, respectively.

defined contribution plans—non-u.s.

we
have defined contribution plans in a variety of non-u.s. locations. 


our
total combined expense for these defined contribution plans for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $12 million, $13 million and
$14 million, respectively, primarily related to the huntsman uk pension plan. 

all
uk associates are eligible to participate in the huntsman uk pension plan, a contract-based arrangement with a third party. company contributions vary by business during a five year
transition period. plan participants elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their compensation. we contribute a matching amount not to exceed 12% of the
participant's salary for new hires and 15% of the participant's salary for all other participants. 







supplemental salary deferral plan and supplemental executive retirement plan  

the huntsman supplemental savings plan (the "ssp") is a non-qualified plan covering key management employees and allows participants to defer
amounts that would otherwise be paid as compensation. the participant can defer up to 75% of their salary and bonus each year. this plan also provides benefits that would be provided under the
huntsman salary deferral plan if that plan were not subject to legal limits on the amount of contributions that can be allocated to an individual in a single year. the ssp was amended and restated
effective as of january 1, 2005 to allow eligible executive employees to comply with section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986. 

the
huntsman supplemental executive retirement plan (the "serp") is an unfunded non-qualified pension plan established to provide certain executive employees with benefits that could not
be provided, due to legal limitations, under the huntsman defined benefit pension plan, a qualified defined benefit pension plan, and the huntsman money purchase pension plan, a qualified money
purchase pension plan. 

assets
of these plans are included in other noncurrent assets and as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $27 million and $26 million, respectively. during each of the
years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we expensed a total of $1 million as contributions to the ssp and the serp. 







stock-based incentive plan  

on may 5, 2016, our stockholders approved a new huntsman corporation 2016 stock incentive plan (the "2016 stock incentive plan"), which
reserved 8.2 million shares for issuance. the huntsman corporation stock incentive plan, as amended and restated (the "prior plan"), remains in effect for outstanding awards granted pursuant to
the prior plan, but no further awards may be granted under the prior plan. under the 2016 stock incentive plan, we may grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance share units and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided
that incentive stock options may be granted solely to employees. the terms of the grants under both the 2016 stock incentive plan and the prior plan are fixed at the grant date. as of
december 31, 2016, we had approximately 8 million shares remaining under the 2016 stock incentive plan available for grant. see "note 23. stock-based compensation plan."

after
extensive research and analysis, in 2014, we made certain elections and filed amended u.s. tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2012, along with our original u.s. tax return for
tax year 2013. these new tax elections and amended tax returns allowed us to utilize u.s. foreign tax credits. the net result was $104 million of income tax benefit recognized during 2014 for
the release of the associated valuation allowance. 

during
2015, we declared a dividend from our non-u.s. operations to the u.s. which included bringing onshore certain u.s. foreign tax credits. the foreign tax credits brought onshore
exceeded the amount needed to offset the cash tax impact of the dividend, as well as enough to allow us to carry $14 million of foreign tax credits back to a prior year and claim a refund. 

included
in the non-u.s. deferred tax expense are income tax benefits of $1 million in 2016, $3 million in 2015 and $7 million in 2014 for losses from continuing
operations for certain jurisdictions with valuation allowances to the extent that income was recorded in other comprehensive income in that same jurisdiction. the benefits in 2016 were largely
attributable to south africa, and the benefits in 2015 and 2014 were largely attributable to the u.k. in all years, foreign currency gains and changes in pension related items resulted in income in
other comprehensive income where we have a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset. an offsetting income tax expense was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

19. income taxes (continued) 

we
operate in many non-u.s. tax jurisdictions with no specific country earning a predominant amount of our off-shore earnings. the vast majority of these countries have income tax rates
that are lower than the u.s. statutory rate. during 2016 and 2014, the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax income was lower than the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax
losses, resulting in net benefits as compared to the u.s. statutory rate of $47 million and $7 million, respectively, reflected in the reconciliation above. in 2016, the $47 million net
benefit relates primarily to our polyurethanes operations in the netherlands and china and our advanced materials operations in switzerland. during 2015, the average statutory rate for countries with
pre-tax losses was lower than the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax income, resulting in net expenses as compared to the u.s. statutory rate of $4 million, reflected in the
reconciliation above. 

in
certain non-u.s. tax jurisdictions, our u.s. gaap functional currency is different than the local tax currency. as a result, foreign exchange gains and losses will impact our
effective tax rate. for 2016, this resulted in a $4 million tax benefit, for 2015, this resulted in a $33 million tax benefit ($58 million, net of $25 million of contingent
liabilities and valuation allowances) and for 2014, this resulted in a $7 million tax benefit. a number of our intercompany liabilities that were denominated in u.s. dollars were owed by
entities whose tax currency was the euro. as a result of the depreciation in the euro opposite the u.s. dollar, these entities recorded a tax only foreign exchange loss. most of the intercompany
receivables associated with these same u.s. dollar denominated intercompany debts were held by entities with a tax currency of the u.s. dollar which, therefore, resulted in no taxable gain. 

during
2015, we were granted an extension of a tax holiday from 2015 to 2022 on certain of our manufacturing operations in singapore. during 2015, pursuant to the singapore tax holiday,
we recorded a benefit of $6 million. we will continue to enjoy this benefit to the extent of continuing profits in this manufacturing endeavor. there were no net tax benefits recorded in 2016. 

we
calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities related to u.s. state income taxes based on projected apportionment factors. during 2015, we experienced a decrease in our projected
apportionment factors, which decreased our deferred tax liability for u.s. state income taxes. the amount of our deferred tax
liability for u.s. state income taxes is significant, and therefore, the change in apportionment factors for 2015 decreased our net deferred tax liabilities by $5 million. also during 2015, we
changed the legal entity location of certain of our u.s. operations. these changes had the effect of reducing our state tax expense by approximately $3 million. 


the
components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows (dollars in millions):

we
have gross nols of $3,407 million in various non-u.s. jurisdictions. while the majority of the non-u.s. nols have no expiration date, $475 million have a limited life
(of which $448 million are subject to a valuation allowance) and $3 million are scheduled to expire in 2017 (all of which are subject to a valuation allowance). we had no nols expire
unused in 2016. 

included
in the $3,407 million of gross non-u.s. nols is $940 million attributable to our luxembourg entities. as of december 31, 2016, due to the uncertainty
surrounding the realization of the benefits of these losses, there is a valuation allowance of $211 million against these net tax-effected nols of $255 million. 

we
evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by
jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. these conclusions
require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable
period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future.

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued) 







19. income taxes (continued) 

our
judgments regarding valuation allowances are also influenced by the costs and risks associated with any tax planning idea. 

during
2016, we established valuation allowances of $12 million and released valuation allowances of $25 million. in italy we established $9 million of valuation
allowances on certain net deferred tax assets as a result of the sale of our european surfactants business, and in china we established $3 million of valuation allowances as a result of the
closure of our qingdao, china plant. we released valuation allowances of $12 million in spain as a result of cumulative profitability, $7 million in the netherlands as a result of tax
planning to utilize losses that would have otherwise expired, and $6 million in france as a result of a tax combination allowing deferred tax liabilities to be offset by deferred tax assets
which previously had a valuation allowance. 

during
2015, we established valuation allowances of $35 million and released valuation allowances of $3 million. in the u.s., we established $14 million of valuation
allowance on u.s. foreign tax credits due to the application of specific foreign tax credit limitations, in the netherlands we established $7 million
of valuation allowance on losses which are scheduled to expire after 2016, and in italy we established $12 million of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets as a result of
cumulative losses. 

during
2014, we released valuation allowances of $111 million and established valuation allowances of $3 million. in the u.s., we released $94 million of valuation
allowance on u.s. foreign tax credits as a result of making certain tax elections and filing amended u.s. tax returns and in luxembourg we released a valuation allowance on $6 million of
certain net deferred tax assets as a result of significant changes in estimated future taxable income resulting from increased intercompany receivables and, therefore, increased interest income in
luxembourg, our primary treasury center outside of the u.s. 

uncertainties
regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions and result in additional valuation
allowances in future periods, or, in the case of unexpected pre-tax earnings, the release of valuation allowances in future periods.

as
of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $21 million and $50 million,
respectively. 

during
2016, we concluded and settled tax examinations on various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, china, germany, indonesia, the netherlands, spain and the u.k.
during 2015, we concluded and effectively settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to china and france.
during 2014, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, china, france and spain. 

during
2016, for unrecognized tax benefits that impact tax expense, we recorded a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits with a corresponding income tax benefit (not including
interest and penalty expense) of $5 million. during 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net increase in unrecognized tax benefits with a corresponding income tax expense (not including interest and
penalty expense) of $19 million and $1 million, respectively. additional decreases in unrecognized tax benefits were offset by cash settlements or by a decrease in net deferred tax
assets and, therefore, did not affect income tax expense. 

in
accordance with our accounting policy, we continue to recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

19. income taxes (continued) 

we
conduct business globally and, as a result, we file income tax returns in u.s. federal, various u.s. state and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the following table summarizes the tax
years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions:

certain
of our u.s. and non-u.s. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities and the amounts ultimately agreed upon in resolution of the
issues raised may differ materially from the amounts accrued. 

we
estimate that it is reasonably possible that certain of our non-u.s. unrecognized tax benefits could change within 12 months of the reporting date with a resulting decrease in
the unrecognized tax benefits within a reasonably possible range of nil to $6 million. for the 12-month period from the reporting date, we would expect that a substantial portion of the
decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits would result in a corresponding benefit to our income tax expense. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that are reinvested
and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. we have material intercompany debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation and our ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of intercompany debt owned by our
non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend, we expect to utilize our intercompany debt. if any earnings
were repatriated via dividend, we may need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. 

as
discussed, we made a distribution of a portion of our earnings in 2015 when the amount of foreign tax credits associated with the distribution was greater than the amount of tax
otherwise due. the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries with positive earnings that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately $390 million at december 31, 2016.
it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings because of the significant assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

20. commitments and contingencies  







purchase commitments  

we have various purchase commitments extending through 2029 for materials, supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of
business. included in the purchase commitments table below are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2017.
certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period,
such notice period has been included in the table below. the contractual purchase prices for substantially all of these contracts are variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations.
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume
is purchased. we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made minimum payments of
$2 million, nil and nil, respectively, under such take or pay contracts without taking the product. 

total
purchase commitments as of december 31, 2016 are as follows (dollars in millions):

agreements in our consolidated statements of operations is approximately $89 million, $94 million and $97 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, net of sublease rentals of
approximately $2 million, $3 million and $3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

legal matters  








antitrust matters  

we were named as a defendant in consolidated class action civil antitrust suits filed on february 9 and 12, 2010 in the u.s. district
court for the district of maryland alleging that we, our co-defendants and other alleged co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the u.s. between at least march 1,
2002 and the present. the other defendants named in this matter were dupont, kronos and cristal (formerly millennium). on august 28, 2012, the court certified a class consisting of all u.s.
customers who purchased titanium dioxide directly from the defendants since february 1, 2003 (the "direct purchasers"). on december 13, 2013, we and all other defendants settled the
direct purchasers litigation and the court approved the settlement. we paid the settlement in an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. 

on
november 22, 2013, we were named as a defendant in a civil antitrust suit filed in the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota brought by a direct purchaser who opted
out of the direct purchasers class litigation (the "opt-out litigation"). on april 21, 2014, the court severed the claims against us from the other defendants sued and ordered our case
transferred to the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas. subsequently, kronos, another defendant, was also severed from the minnesota case and claims against it were transferred and
consolidated for trial with our case in the southern district of texas. on february 26, 2016, we reached an agreement to settle the opt-out litigation and subsequently paid the settlement in an
amount immaterial to our financial statements. 

we
were also named as a defendant in a class action civil antitrust suit filed on march 15, 2013 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california by the
purchasers of products made from titanium dioxide (the "indirect purchasers") making essentially the same allegations as did the direct purchasers. on october 14, 2014, plaintiffs filed their
second amended class action complaint narrowing the class of plaintiffs to those merchants and consumers of architectural coatings containing titanium dioxide. on august 11, 2015, the court
granted our motion to dismiss the indirect purchasers litigation with leave to amend the complaint. a third amended class action complaint was filed on

september 29,
2015 further limiting the class to consumers of architectural paints. plaintiffs have raised state antitrust claims under the laws of 15 states, consumer protection claims under
the laws of nine states and unjust enrichment claims under the laws of 16 states. on november 4, 2015, we and our co-defendants filed another motion to dismiss. on june 13, 2016, the
court substantially denied the motion to dismiss except as to consumer protection claims in one state. the parties are presently negotiating a settlement for an amount immaterial to our consolidated
financial statements. 

on
august 23, 2016, we were named as a defendant in a fourth civil antitrust suit filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california by an indirect
purchaser, home depot. home depot is an indirect purchaser primarily through paints it purchases from various manufacturers. home depot makes the same claims as the direct and indirect purchasers. 

the
plaintiffs in the indirect purchasers claims seek to recover injunctive relief, treble damages or the maximum damages allowed by state law, costs of suit and attorneys' fees. we are
not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our employees. nevertheless, we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts which in the aggregate could
be material to us. because of the overall complexity of these cases, we are unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss and we have made no accrual with respect to the home depot
claims. 







product delivery claim  

we have been notified by a customer of potential claims related to our alleged delivery of a different product than the one the customer had
ordered. our customer claims that it was unaware that the different product had been delivered until after that product had been used to manufacture materials which were subsequently sold. originally,
the customer stated that it had been notified of claims by its customers of up to an aggregate of €153 million (approximately $159 million) relating to this matter and
claimed that we may be responsible for all or a portion of these potential claims. our customer has since resolved some of these claims and the aggregate amount of the current claims is now
approximately €113 million (approximately $117 million). based on the facts currently available, we believe that we are insured for any liability we may ultimately have
in excess of $10 million. however, no assurance can be given regarding our ultimate liability or costs. we believe our range of possible loss in this matter is between €0 and
€113 million (approximately $117 million), and we have made no accrual with respect to this matter. 







indemnification matters  

on july 3, 2012, deutsche bank securities inc. and credit suisse securities (usa) llc (the "banks") demanded that we
indemnify them for claims brought against them by certain matlinpatterson entities that were formerly our stockholders ("matlinpatterson") in litigation filed by matlinpatterson on june 19,
2012 in the 9th district court in montgomery county, texas (the "texas litigation"). these claims allegedly arose from the failed acquisition by and merger with hexion. the texas litigation was
dismissed, which was upheld by the ninth court of appeals and the texas supreme court denied review by final order entered january 7, 2016. 

on
july 14, 2014, the banks demanded that we indemnify them for additional claims brought against them by certain other former company stockholders in litigation filed
june 14, 2014 in the

20. commitments and contingencies (continued) 

united
states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin (the "wisconsin litigation"). the stockholders in the wisconsin litigation have made essentially the same factual allegations as
matlinpatterson made in the texas litigation and, additionally, have named apollo global management llc and apollo management holdings, l.p. as defendants. stockholder plaintiffs in the
wisconsin litigation assert claims for misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud. on june 30, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the apollo defendants and on december 5, 2016,
the court dismissed deutsche bank for lack of personal jurisdiction, but denied credit suisse's motion to dismiss. subsequently, credit suisse asked the court to reconsider its decision or certify its
judgment to the seventh circuit court of appeals for an immediate appeal, which remains pending. we denied the banks' indemnification demand for both the texas litigation and the wisconsin litigation. 







other proceedings  

we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under provisions of
applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters will have
a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 







21. environmental, health and safety matters  







ehs capital expenditures  

we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair
pollution control equipment. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled $66 million, $141 million, and
$125 million, respectively. because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of
specific requirements, our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future
amounts we may spend related to ehs and other applicable laws. 







environmental reserves  

we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties.
liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimates are calculated using present value techniques as
appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. the environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as
asset retirement obligations. we had accrued $34 million and $38 million for environmental liabilities as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. of these amounts,
$7 million and $6 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $27 million and $32 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated
balance sheets as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in certain cases, our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years.

21. environmental, health and safety matters (continued) 

we
may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess. 







environmental matters  

under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") and similar state laws, a current or former owner or
operator of real property in the u.s. may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and
a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. outside the u.s., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in
effect in france and australia, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. currently, there are approximately six former facilities or third-party sites in the
u.s. for which we have been notified of potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed under cercla. based on current information and past experiences
at other cercla sites, we do not expect these third-party claims to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

under
the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") in the u.s. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition
to our hazardous waste permit. some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. we are aware of soil,
groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. for example, our port neches, texas, and geismar, louisiana,
facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements imposed under rcra. similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing
facilities, such as australia, india, france, hungary and italy. 







west footscray remediation  

by letter dated march 7, 2006, our former base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray, australia was issued a cleanup notice
by the environmental protection authority victoria ("epa victoria") due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. on august 23, 2010, epa victoria revoked a
second cleanup notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation. as of december 31, 2016, we had an accrued liability of approximately
$15 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site. we can provide no assurance that the authority will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or
that additional costs will not be required for the cleanup. 







north maybe mine remediation  

the north maybe canyon mine site is a cercla site and involves a former phosphorous mine near soda springs, idaho, which is believed to have
been operated by several companies, including a predecessor company to us. in 2004, the u.s. forest service notified us that we are a cercla potentially responsible party ("prp") for contamination
originating from the site. in february 2010, we and wells cargo (another prp) agreed to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study of a

portion
of the site and are currently engaged in that process. at this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate our potential liabilities at this site. 








port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the u.s. department of
justice (the "doj") notified us that we were in
violation of the caa based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the enforcement initiative to bring similar actions against refiners and other
chemical manufacturers and has sought to collect civil penalties in excess of $100,000. specifically, the epa alleged violations at our port neches, texas facility from 2007-2012 for flare operations
not consistent with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these findings, the epa referred this matter to the doj. we provided a
formal response to the doj and the epa with a supplemental data submission on april 29, 2013. we have been engaged in discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these alleged violations and
conducted field trials on an alternate flare monitoring method beginning in september 2014. we are currently unable to determine the likelihood or magnitude of any potential penalty or injunctive
relief that may be incurred in resolving this matter. 







22. huntsman corporation stockholders' equity  







share repurchase program  

on september 29, 2015, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our common
stock. repurchases under this program may be made through open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or by other means. the timing and actual
number of any shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including market conditions. the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and repurchases may be commenced,
suspended or discontinued from time to time without prior notice. on october 27, 2015, we entered into and funded an accelerated share repurchase agreement with citibank, n.a. to repurchase
$100 million of our common stock. citibank, n.a. made an initial delivery of approximately 7.1 million shares of huntsman corporation common stock based on the closing price of $11.94 on
october 27, 2015. the accelerated share repurchase agreement was completed in january 2016 with the delivery of an additional approximately 1.5 million shares of huntsman corporation
common stock. the final number of shares repurchased and the
aggregate cost per share was based on the company's daily volume-weighted average stock price during the term of the transaction, less a discount. we have $50 million remaining that is
available under this authorization to be used to purchase additional shares.

23. stock-based compensation plan  


under the 2016 stock incentive plan, we may grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance share units
and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock options may be granted solely to employees.
the terms of the grants under both the 2016 stock incentive plan and the prior plan are fixed at the grant date. as of december 31, 2016, we were authorized to grant up to 8.2 million
shares under the 2016 stock incentive plan. as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately 8 million shares remaining under the 2016 stock incentive plan available for grant. option
awards have a maximum contractual term of
10 years and generally must have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of our common stock on the date the option award is granted. outstanding stock-based awards generally vest
over a three-year period; certain performance share unit awards vest over a two-year period. 


the
compensation cost from continuing operations under the 2016 stock incentive plan and the prior plan for our company and huntsman international were as follows (dollars in millions):

the
total income tax benefit recognized in the statement of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements was $7 million, $6 million and $6 million for the
years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 







stock options  

the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model that uses the assumptions
noted in the following table. expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock through the grant date. the expected term of options granted was estimated based on the
contractual term of the instruments and employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was
based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the assumptions noted below represent the weighted averages of the assumptions utilized for all stock options granted during the
year.

the
weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $3.15, $9.81 and $9.63 per option, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, there
was $10 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option arrangements granted under the 2016 stock incentive plan and the prior plan. that cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years.

23. stock-based compensation plan (continued) 

during
the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was approximately $1 million, nil and $14 million,
respectively. 







nonvested shares  

nonvested shares granted under the 2016 stock incentive plan and the prior plan consist of restricted stock and performance share unit awards,
which are accounted for as equity awards, and phantom stock, which is accounted for as a liability award because it can be settled in either stock or cash. 

the
fair value of each performance share unit award is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model that uses various assumptions, including an expected volatility rate and a risk-free
interest rate. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, the weighted-average expected volatility rate was 39.3% and 30.0%, respectively and the weighted average risk-free interest rate
was 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. for the performance share unit awards granted during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 the number of shares earned varies based upon the company
achieving certain performance criteria over two-year and three-year performance periods. the performance criteria are total stockholder return of our common stock relative to the total stockholder
return of a specified industry peer group for the two-year and three-year performance periods. no performance share unit awards were granted during the year ended december 31, 2014.

termination of employment.  
 
as
of december 31, 2016, there was $28 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share compensation arrangements granted under the stock
incentive plan and the prior plan. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. the value of share awards that vested during the years ended
december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $16 million, $20 million and $19 million, respectively.

25. related party transactions (continued)  


our subsidiary airstar corporation ("airstar") subleases a gulfstream iv-sp aircraft (the "aircraft") from jstar corporation ("jstar"), a corporation wholly owned by jon m. huntsman
pursuant to a lease arrangement that expires in 2021. jon m. huntsman is the executive chairman and the father of our chief executive officer, peter r. huntsman. under this arrangement, monthly
sublease payments from airstar to jstar are approximately $120,000, and an aggregate of $7 million is payable through the end of the remaining five year lease term. these monthly sublease
payments are equal to the financing costs paid by jstar to a leasing company and the arrangement does not result in a financial benefit to jstar. 

we
occupy and use a portion of an office building owned by the huntsman foundation, a private charitable foundation established by jon m. and karen h. huntsman to further the charitable
interests of the huntsman family, under a lease pursuant to which we make annual lease payments. with the scheduled transition of employees to the woodlands, texas the original lease rate was reduced
by 50% effective february 1, 2016. during 2016, we made payments of approximately $1 million to the huntsman foundation under the lease, which includes a contractual 2% increase from
2015. the lease expires on december 31, 2018, subject to a five-year extension, at our option. 


through
may 2002, we paid the premiums on various life insurance policies for jon m. huntsman. these policies have been liquidated, and the cash values have been paid to
mr. huntsman. mr. huntsman is indebted to us in the amount of approximately $2 million with accrued interest, which represents the insurance premiums paid on his behalf through
may 2002. this amount is included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 

effective
august 31, 2015, we entered into a consulting agreement with jon m. huntsman, jr., one of our former directors and the former governor of utah and u.s. ambassador to
singapore and china. pursuant to the consulting agreement, jon m. huntsman, jr. agreed to: provide strategic advice to senior management and the board of directors of the company on political,
economic and business matters; support development and continued maintenance of the company's high value customers and significant business relationships across all regions; support development and
continued maintenance of
governmental and business relationships in developing economic regions, particularly in connection with markets and opportunities in india, china and southeast asia; participate in negotiations and
discussions with business executives and leaders, government officials and/or dignitaries; and participate in such other meetings or discussions as may be requested by senior management of the company
upon reasonable notice. in exchange for these services, we agree to pay jon m. huntsman, jr. $50,000 per month and up to $200,000 in additional compensation based on achievement of designated results
as determined by the board of directors. the consulting agreement was renewed for one year effective august 31, 2016, subject to our right to extend the agreement for additional one year terms.
jon m. huntsman, jr. is the son of our executive chairman, jon m. huntsman and the brother of our chief executive officer, peter r. huntsman.

(1)beginning
in the second quarter of 2016, we use segment adjusted ebitda as the measure of each segment's profit or loss. we believe that segment adjusted ebitda more
accurately reflects what management uses to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their financial performance. we have recast the measure of each segment's profit
or loss in the prior periods disclosed to reflect segment adjusted ebitda. 


segment
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income of huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests and certain corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting
adjustments; (b) ebitda from discontinued operations; (c) gain (loss) on disposition of businesses/assets; (d) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (e) certain legal
settlements and related expenses; (f) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (g) net plant incident remediation costs; (h) restructuring, impairment, plant
closing and transition costs; and (i) spin-off separation expenses.  

(2)corporate
and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, lifo inventory valuation reserve adjustments,
nonoperating income and expense, benzene sales and gains and losses on the disposition of corporate assets.

(1)on
december 30, 2016, our performance products segment completed the sale of its european surfactants business to innospec inc. for $199 million
in cash plus our retention of trade receivables and payables for an enterprise value of $225 million. for further information, see "note 3. business combinations and
dispositions—sale of european surfactants manufacturing facilities."
(2)basic
and diluted income per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during that period. therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share.
(3)during
the three months ended december 31, 2015, we declared a dividend from our non-u.s. operations to the u.s., which included bringing onshore certain u.s.
foreign tax credits. the foreign tax credits brought onshore exceeded the amount needed to offset the cash tax impact of the dividend, as well as enough to allow us to carry $14 million of
foreign tax credits back to a prior year and claim a refund. during 2015, a number of our intercompany liabilities that were denominated in u.s. dollars were owed by entities whose tax currency was
the euro. as a result of the depreciation in the euro opposite the u.s. dollar, these entities recorded a tax only foreign exchange loss. most of the intercompany receivables associated with these
same u.s. dollar denominated intercompany debts were held by entities with a tax currency of the u.s. dollar which, therefore, resulted in no taxable gain. this resulted in a $33 million tax
benefit ($58 million, net of $25 million of contingent liabilities and valuation allowances) in the fourth quarter of 2015.
