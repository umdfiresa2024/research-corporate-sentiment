our
principal executive offices are located at 500 huntsman way, salt lake city, utah 84108, and our telephone number at that location is (801) 584-5700. 








recent developments  







rockwood acquisition  

on october 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses (the "rockwood
acquisition") of rockwood holdings, inc. ("rockwood"). these businesses manufacture and market titanium dioxide and performance additives products. we paid $1.04 billion in cash, subject
to certain purchase price adjustments, and assumed certain unfunded pension liabilities in connection with the rockwood acquisition. the rockwood acquisition was financed using a bank term loan. 


the
following businesses were acquired from rockwood:



• titanium dioxide, a white pigment derived from titanium bearing ores, with strong specialty business in fibers, inks, pharmaceuticals,
food and cosmetics; 
• functional additives made from barium and zinc-based inorganics used to make colors more brilliant, primarily in plastics, coatings,
films, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and paper industries; 
• color pigments made from synthetic iron-oxide and other (not titanium dioxide) inorganic pigments used by manufacturers of coatings
and colorants; 
• timber treatment wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications;  
• water treatment products used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications; and  
• specialty automotive molded components. 


the
unaudited condensed combined balance sheet of the acquired businesses as of june 30, 2014 and the unaudited condensed combined statements of operations, comprehensive income
(loss), cash flows, and changes in parent company equity of the acquired businesses for the six months ended june 30, 2014 and june 30, 2013 can be found in our current report on
form 8-k filed on october 7, 2014. 

in
connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the rockwood acquisition, we sold our tio2 tr52 product line used in printing inks to henan billions
chemicals co., ltd. ("henan") in december 2014. the sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply tr52 to henan.

pigments and additives restructuring  

on december 1, 2014, we announced that we are taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our pigments
and additives segment. as part of a comprehensive restructuring program, we plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 900 positions. annual cost savings are expected to exceed $130 million
and are expected to be achieved by the middle of 2016. in connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related
primarily to workforce reductions. we expect to record additional restructuring expense in 2015 once negotiations of employee termination benefits with european works councils are completed. 

on
february 12, 2015, we announced plans to reduce our titanium dioxide capacity by approximately 100 kt by closing specific operations at our calais, france facility,
subject to consultation with employees and appropriate representative groups. annual cost savings are expected to be approximately $35 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of
2016. this plan is in addition to that announced on december 1, 2014. 







notes issuance  

in november 2014, huntsman international issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes carrying an interest
rate of 5.125% and maturing on november 15, 2022 (the "2022 senior notes"). we used the net proceeds of this offering to redeem all of our 8.625% senior subordinated notes due 2020 (the "2020
senior subordinated notes"), including accrued interest, and for general corporate purposes. 







overview  

we operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our
products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of
applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging,
paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines,
surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. our administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations
are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below, which are located in more than 30 countries. as of december 31, 2014, we employed
approximately 16,000 associates worldwide. our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $11,578 million, $11,079 million and $11,187 million,
respectively. 







our products  

we produce differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials and
textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces primarily inorganic chemical products. 

growth
in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. accordingly, the profitability
of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the petrochemical

polyurethanes  







general  

we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including mdi products, po, polyols, pg
and tpu (each discussed in more detail below under "—products and markets"). polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants
and elastomers. we focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued
substitution of mdi-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. we operate five primary polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. we also
operate 18 polyurethane systems houses located in close proximity to our customers worldwide (see facilities listed in "—item 2. properties" below), which we believe enables us to
focus on customer support and service. we also operate a specialty polyol manufacturing facility focused on the insulation market and three tpu manufacturing facilities in the u.s., europe and china. 


our
customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as mdi, with polyols, which are derived largely from po and eo. we are able to produce over
2,000 distinct mdi-based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations.
as a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from mdi, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and
appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, adhesives, wood binders, footwear and other specialized engineering applications. 


we
are one of three north american producers of po. we and some of our customers process po into derivative products, such as polyols for polyurethane products, pg and various other
chemical products. end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings, construction, appliances, packaging, automotive and transportation, food, paints and coatings
and cleaning products industries. we also produce mtbe as a co-product of our po manufacturing process. mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to
enhance the octane rating of gasoline. see "—item 1a. risk factors." 

in
1992, we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china. we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated
polyurethanes formulation facility. in january 2003, we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai, china. production at our mdi finishing
plant near shanghai, china operated by hps, a consolidated joint venture, was commissioned on june 30, 2006. production at the mnb, aniline and crude mdi plants operated by slic, an
unconsolidated joint venture, commenced on september 30, 2006. we intend to significantly expand the capacity of these facilities by 2017. these world-scale facilities strengthen our ability to
service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the significant demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. additionally, in november 2012, we entered
into an agreement to form a joint venture to build a world scale po and mtbe plant in nanjing, china. the facility is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, and it will utilize
our proprietary po/mtbe manufacturing technology. we own a 49% interest in the joint venture.

on
august 29, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the chemical business of oxid l.p. (the "oxid acquisition"), a privately-held manufacturer and marketer of specialty
urethane polyols based in houston, texas, for approximately $76 million. 







products and markets  

mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam and coatings,
adhesives, sealants and elastomers. polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with mdi in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. po is one of the
principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols. the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. 



  

polyurethane
chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. depending on their needs, customers will use either commodity polyurethane
chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. by varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are
able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products. 


mdi.    mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane materials. this is primarily
because mdi can be used
to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued
substitution of mdi-based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction. we expect that other markets, such as binders for reconstituted wood
board products, specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi. 

with
the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies, the asian markets have now become the largest in the world for mdi. 

mdi
experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. sales generally peak
during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year.

table of contents

tpu.    tpu is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with
polyols to produce
unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength,
abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers. tpu is used in injection molding
and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. it is also extruded into films, wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and
elastomers markets. 

polyols.    polyols are combined with mdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products. demand for
specialty polyols has
been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown. 

aniline.    aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi. generally, aniline is either consumed internally
or is sold to third
parties under long-term supply contracts. we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with
an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract. 

po.    po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg. demand for po depends largely on
overall economic demand,
especially that of consumer durables. the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po. 



  

mtbe.    mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of
gasoline. while mtbe
has been effectively eliminated in the united states, demand continues to grow in other regions of the world. in 2011, we announced the signing of a license agreement with chinese chemicals
manufacturer yantai wanhua polyurethanes co., ltd, for the production of po and mtbe. on november 13, 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec. the
joint venture involves the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec
holds a 51% interest. see "—item 1a. risk factors." we continue to sell mtbe for use as a gasoline additive, substantially all of which is sold for use outside the u.s. see

sales and marketing  

our global sales group markets our polyurethane chemicals to over 3,500 customers in more than 90 countries. our sales and technical
resources are organized to support major regional markets, as well as key end-use markets which require a more global approach. these key end-use markets include the appliance, automotive, footwear,
furniture and coatings, construction products, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. 


we
provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of "systems" in which we provide the total isocyanate and
polyol formulation to our customers in ready-to-use form. our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers' needs is critical to our
long-term success. we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as "systems houses," close to our customers, enabling us to
focus on customer support and technical service. we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further
product and service needs of customers. we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers' requirements. 


we
believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have
facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing
innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service. 







manufacturing and operations  

our mdi production facilities are located in geismar, louisiana; rotterdam, the netherlands; and through our joint ventures in caojing,
china. these facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of mdi, from our facilities located in geismar, louisiana; wilton, u.k.; and caojing, china. we believe that
this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers. in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw
materials, integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices.

(2)represents
our approximately 85% share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation. 
 
at
our geismar, rotterdam and caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce mdi. this technology contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer.
in addition to mdi, we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po. we own or license all technology and know-how developed and utilized at our po facility. our process combines
isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation (peroxidation) reactors, thereby forming tbhp and tba, which are further processed into po and mtbe, respectively. because our po production process is
less expensive
relative to other technologies and allows po co-products to be processed into saleable or useable materials, we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its
alternatives. 







joint ventures  

rubicon joint venture.    chemtura corporation is our joint venture partner in rubicon llc, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene
and dpa
manufacturing facilities in geismar, louisiana. we are entitled to approximately 85% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc, and chemtura corporation is entitled to
100% of the dpa production. in addition to operating the joint venture's aniline, nitrobenzene and dpa facilities, rubicon llc also operates our wholly owned mdi, polyol and maleic anhydride
facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex. as a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs
for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements. 

chinese mdi joint ventures.    we are involved in two related joint ventures which operate mdi production facilities near shanghai,
china. slic, our
manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies, produces mnb, aniline and crude mdi. we effectively own 35% of slic and account for our investment under the equity method.
hps, our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd, manufactures pure mdi, polymeric mdi and mdi variants. we own 70% of hps and it is a consolidated affiliate.
these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. the total production capacity of the slic facilities is 660 million pounds
per year of mdi and the splitting capacity of the hps facility is 350 million pounds per year of mdi. 

chinese po/mtbe joint venture.    on november 13, 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with
sinopec. the joint
venture involves the construction and operation of a po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51% interest. our
total equity investment is anticipated to be approximately $90 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. the timing of equity contributions and license fee payments depends on
various factors, but the majority are expected to be made over the course of the construction period of the plant (expected to be completed in the second half of 2016). at the end of
2014, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. 







raw materials  

the primary raw materials for mdi-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po. benzene is a widely available commodity that is the
primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline. historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture
nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce mdi. 

9






 



































table of contents 

a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po. the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us
access to a competitively priced, strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products. the primary raw materials used in our po production process are
butane/isobutane, propylene, methanol and oxygen. we purchase a large portion of our raw materials under long-term contracts. 








competition  

our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include basf, bayer, dow, yantai wanhua and lyondellbasell. while these
competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on mdi and mdi-based polyurethane systems. our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic
ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical
and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with innovative
solutions to their needs. 

some
of our competitors in the polyurethanes segment are among the world's largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies. these competitors may have their own raw
material resources. some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can. in addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them
to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. if any of our current or future competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them
to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. 







performance products  







general  

our performance products segment has leading positions in the manufacture and sale of amines, surfactants and maleic anhydride and
serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets. our performance products segment is organized by strategic business units ("sbus") which differentiate between specialties and
intermediates. 

in
our specialty sbus (energy, materials, additives, processing chemicals and agrochemicals) we are a leading global producer of amines, carbonates, maleic anhydride and specialty
surfactants. growth in demand in our specialty markets tends to be driven by the end-performance characteristics that our products deliver to our customers. these products are manufactured for use in
a growing number of niche industrial end uses and have been characterized by growing demand, technology substitution and stable profitability. for example, we are one of two significant global
producers of polyetheramines, for which our sales volumes have grown at a compound annual rate of over 7% in the last 10 years due to strong demand in a number of industrial applications, such
as epoxy curing agents, oil drilling, agrochemicals, fuel additives and civil construction materials. we are the leading global licensor of maleic anhydride manufacturing technology and are also the
largest supplier of butane fixed bed catalyst used in the manufacture of maleic anhydride. our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other performance products businesses and other
segments. 

in
our intermediate sbus we consume internally produced and third-party-sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants, lab, and ethanolamines products, which are
primarily used in detergency, consumer products and industrial applications. we also produce eg, which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and pet packaging. we operate 17

lubricants, and polymers and coatings. our key surfactants customers include the sun products corporation, l'oreal, monsanto, nufarm, clorox, henkel, colgate, procter & gamble
and unilever. 

we
are north america's largest producer of lab, with alkylation capacity of 400 million pounds per year at our plant in chocolate bayou, texas. lab is a surfactant intermediate
which is converted into las, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. we also manufacture a higher-molecular-weight
alkylate which is used as an additive to lubricants. our key customers for lab and specialty alkylates include colgate, lubrizol, procter & gamble, and unilever. 

we
believe we are the largest global producer of maleic anhydride, a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce uprs, which are mainly used in the production of
fiberglass
reinforced resins for marine, automotive and construction products. maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners. we have the capacity to
produce approximately 572 million pounds annually at our facilities located in pensacola, florida; geismar, louisiana; and moers, germany. we also license our maleic anhydride technology and
supply our catalysts to licensees and to worldwide merchant customers. revenue from licensing and catalyst comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits and catalyst change
schedules. our key maleic anhydride customers include, aoc, ashland, bartek, ccp composites, cranston, dixie, gulf chemical, lubrizol, meadwestvaco, mfg chemical, reichhold and tate & lyle. 

we
also have the capacity to produce approximately 945 million pounds of eg annually at our facilities in port neches, texas and botany, australia. 

we
are currently expanding eo capacity at our port neches, texas facility. the additional annual capacity of 265 million pounds is expected to come onstream during the fourth
quarter of 2015. all of the additional eo will be used internally to leverage exisiting capacity for eo derivatives.

during
2013, our performance products segment implemented a restructuring program to refocus our surfactants business in europe designed to improve earnings by approximately
$20 million. in connection with this restructuring, in june 2014 we completed the sale of our european commodity surfactants business, including the ethoxylation facility in lavera, france, to
wilmar europe holdings b.v. and the cessation of commodity surfactants production at the patrica, italy facility during the fourth quarter of 2014. in connection with this program, we recorded
charges of $13 million during 2013 primarily related to workforce reductions. 








products and markets  

specialties.    our specialty sbus are organized around the following end markets: energy, materials,
additives, processing chemicals and agrochemicals. the following table shows the end-market applications specialty products:

amines.    amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various
ethylene and propylene
derivatives. generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, detergent, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. growth in demand for amines is highly correlated
with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets. however, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have grown at rates well in excess
of gdp growth due to new product development, technical innovation, and substitution and replacement of competing products. for example, polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly
sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing
materials. ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia. they are used in the production of a variety of industrial, agricultural and consumer products. there are
a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry. as amines are generally sold based upon 

12




 

table of contents

the
performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use application, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. 

morpholine/dga® agent.    morpholine and dga® agent are produced as co-products by reacting ammonia with deg. morpholine is
used
in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing (as an accelerator) and flocculants for water treatment. dga® agent is primarily used in gas treating, electronics,
herbicides and metalworking end-use applications. 

carbonates.    ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide. carbonates are used as
solvents and as
reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications. they are also increasingly being used as a photo-resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards, solar panels, lcd screens and the
production of lithium batteries. 

maleic anhydride and licensing.    maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or
normal butane through the
use of a catalyst. the largest use of maleic anhydride in the u.s. is in the production of uprs, which we believe account for approximately 48% of north american maleic anhydride demand. total north
american demand for maleic anhydride in 2014 was approximately 658 million pounds. total european demand for maleic anhydride in 2014 was approximately 604 million pounds. generally,
changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs. upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins, which
are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. 

our
maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy-efficient, high-percentage solvent
recovery system. this process competes against two other processes, the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery. we believe that our process is superior in the areas of
feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. the maleic anhydride-based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which
include po, butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks. as a result, the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst.

consumer detergents, industrial and institutional detergents


eg
 
polyester fibers and pet bottle resins, heat transfer and hydraulic fluids, chemical intermediates, natural gas and
hydrocarbon treating agents, unsaturated polyester resins, polyester polyols, plasticizers, solvents



 
surfactants.    surfactants or "surface active agents" are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble
component in the
same molecule. while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications, they are also valued for their emulsification, foaming, dispersing, penetrating and wetting
properties in a variety of industries. 

demand
growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality. the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved
performance characteristics, which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and
properties. for basic surfactants, pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements. 

lab.    lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear
alpha olefins. nearly
all the lab produced globally is converted into las, a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer, industrial and institutional laundry detergents. 

three
major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america: procter & gamble, henkel and the sun products corporation. we believe that over half of
the lab global capacity lies in the hands of six to seven producers, with two to three major producers in each of the three regional markets. growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in
lubricants is expected to be higher than gdp. we have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market. with a significant technical barrier to entry,
our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus lab-only producers.

table of contents

eg.    we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg: meg, deg and teg. meg is consumed primarily in the
polyester (fiber and
bottle resin) and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, solvents and emulsifiers. deg is consumed
internally for the production of morpholine and dga® agent and polyols. teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas. we
continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg. 







sales and marketing  


we sell over 2,000 products to over 4,000 customers globally through our performance products marketing groups, which have extensive
market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships. 

in
our specialty markets (energy, materials, additives, processing chemicals and agrochemicals), our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain
customer applications. we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers. 


our
intermediates are sold mainly into the global home and personal care market for which we have a dedicated marketing group. we also sell eg. 

we
also provide extensive pre- and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development
functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. finally, these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business
leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. in addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that
also sell our products. these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end-use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces. 







manufacturing and operations  

our performance products segment has the capacity to produce more than seven billion pounds annually of a wide variety of products and
formulations at 17 manufacturing locations in north america, eame, asia and australia. these production capacities are as follows:

the sale of the ethoxylation facility in lavera, france in june 2014 and the cessation of production at the patrica, italy commodity surfactants
facility in the fourth quarter of 2014.  
 
our
surfactants and amines facilities are located globally, with broad capabilities in amination, sulfonation and ethoxylation. these facilities have a competitive cost base and use
modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation. 

our
primary ethylene, propylene, eo, eg and ethanolamines facilities are located in port neches, texas alongside our polyurethanes' po/mtbe facility. the port neches, texas facility
benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure, which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products. 

a
number of our facilities are located within large integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes. we believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we
would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand-alone operations. these include our lab facility in chocolate bayou, texas, our maleic anhydride facilities in pensacola, florida and moers,
germany and our ethyleneamines facility in freeport, texas. 







joint ventures  

ethyleneamines joint venture.    since july 1, 2010, we have consolidated the results of arabian amines company, our 50%-owned joint
venture with
the zamil group. arabian amines company operates an ethyleneamines manufacturing plant in jubail, saudi arabia. the plant has an approximate annual capacity of 60 million pounds. we purchase
and sell all of the production from this joint venture. 

maleic anhydride joint venture.    since the second quarter of 2011, we have consolidated the results of sasol-huntsman, our 50%-owned
maleic anhydride
joint venture. this entity operates a manufacturing facility in moers, germany with the capacity to produce 232 million pounds of maleic anhydride. the output from the facility is sold in the
european region. 








raw materials  

we have the capacity to produce 460 million pounds of ethylene and 300 million pounds of propylene, depending on
feedstocks, at our port neches, texas facility. all of the ethylene is used to produce eo and all of the propylene is used to produce po at our port neches, texas facility (primarily for our
polyurethanes segment). we have the capacity to use approximately 900 million pounds of ethylene each year in the production of eo and ethyleneamines. accordingly, we purchase or toll the
remainder of our ethylene requirements from third parties. we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg, surfactants, carbonates and amines products. we also use internally produced po and
deg in the manufacture of these products. 

in
addition to internally produced raw materials, the main raw materials used in the production of our amines are ethylene dichloride, caustic soda, ammonia, hydrogen, methylamines and
acrylonitrile.

table of contents

the
majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices. 


in
the production of surfactants and lab, our primary raw materials, in addition to internally produced and third-party sourced eo and ethylene, are synthetic and natural alcohols,
paraffin, alpha olefins, benzene and nonylphenol. all of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices. 

maleic
anhydride is produced by the reaction of n-butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst. the principal raw material is n-butane which is purchased pursuant to long-term
contracts and delivered to our pensacola, florida site by barge, to our facility in geismar, louisiana via pipeline and to our moers, germany site by railcar. our maleic anhydride catalyst is
toll-manufactured by a third party under a long-term contract according to our proprietary methods. these raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 







competition  

in our specialty markets, there are few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of product
formulations, the proprietary nature of many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved. some of our global
competitors include basf, air products, dow, tosoh and akzonobel. we compete primarily on the basis of product performance, new product innovation and, to a lesser extent, on the basis of price. in
our maleic anhydride market, we compete primarily on the basis of price, customer service, technical support and logistics management. our competitors include lanxess, flint hills resources, bartek,

are used to replace metal rivets and advanced composites are used to replace traditional aluminum panels in the manufacture of aerospace components. our advanced materials segment is
characterized by the breadth of our product offering, our expertise in complex chemistry, our
long-standing relationships with our customers, our ability to develop and adapt our technology and our applications expertise for new markets and new applications. 

we
operate synthesis, formulating and production facilities in north america, europe, asia, south america and africa. we sell to more than 2,500 customers in the following end markets:
civil engineering, consumer appliances, food and beverage packaging, industrial appliances, consumer/do it yourself ("diy"), aerospace, lng transport, electrical power transmission and distribution,
printed circuit boards, consumer and industrial electronics, wind power generation, automotive, recreational sports equipment and medical appliances. 

during
the fourth quarter of 2012, our advanced materials segment began implementing a global transformational change program designed to improve the segment's manufacturing
efficiencies, enhance commercial excellence and improve its long-term global competitiveness. this program is anticipated to deliver approximately $70 million in annualized savings for this
segment. in connection with this program, we recorded charges of $10 million during 2014 related primarily to workforce reductions. through december 31, 2014, we have achieved
approximately $71 million in earnings improvement as a result of this restructuring program. 







products and markets  

our product range spans from basic liquid and solid resins, to specialty components like curing agents, matting agents, accelerators,
cross-linkers, reactive diluents, thermoplastic polyamides and additives. in addition to these components, which we typically sell to formulators in various industries, we also produce and sell ready
to use formulated polymer systems. 

base resins and specialty component markets.    our products are used in the formulation of products for the protection of steel and
concrete
substrates, such as flooring, metal furniture and appliances, buildings, linings for storage tanks and food and beverage cans, and the primer coat of automobile bodies and ships. epoxy-based surface
coatings are among the most widely used industrial coatings due to their structural stability and broad application functionality combined with overall economic efficiency. 

base
resins and specialty components are also used for composite applications. a structural composite is made by combining two or more different materials, such as fibers, resins and
other specialty additives, to create a product with enhanced structural properties. specifically, structural composites are lightweight, high-strength, rigid materials with high resistance to
chemicals, moisture and high temperatures. our product range comprises basic and advanced epoxy resins, curing agents and other
advanced chemicals, additives and formulated polymer systems. the four key target markets for our structural composites are aerospace, power generation (windmill blades) and distribution (composite
reinforced cable), general industrial and automotive applications, and recreational products (mainly sports equipment such as skis). structural composites continue to substitute for traditional
materials, such as metals and wood, in a wide variety of applications due to their light weight, strength and durability. 


formulated systems.    the structural adhesives market requires high-strength "engineering" adhesives for use in the manufacture and
repair of items to
bond various engineering substrates. our business focus is on engineering adhesives based on epoxy, polyurethane, acrylic and other technologies which are used to bond materials, such as steel,
aluminum, engineering plastics and composites in substitution of traditional joining techniques. our araldite® brand name has considerable value in the industrial and consumer adhesives
markets. in many countries, araldite® branded products are known for their high-performance adhesive capabilities, and we generally believe that this is the value- 

18




 

table of contents

added
segment of the market where recognition of our long-standing araldite® brand is a key competitive advantage. packaging is a key characteristic of our adhesives products. our range of
adhesives is sold in a variety of packs and sizes, targeted to three specific end markets and sold through targeted routes to market: 



• general industrial bonding.  we sell a broad range of
advanced formulated adhesives to a broad base of small-to medium-sized customers, including specialty distributors.   
• industry specific.  we sell our adhesive products on a
global basis into diverse, industry-specific markets, which include the aerospace, wind turbine, lng transport, filter bonding, solar cell and other industrial application markets. our target markets
are chosen because we believe it is worthwhile to utilize our direct sales force and applications experts to tailor products and services to suit the needs and performance specifications of the
specific market segments.   
• consumer/diy.  we package and sell consumer adhesives
through strategic distribution arrangements with a number of the major marketers of consumer/diy adhesives, such as vynex, velcro and selleys. these products are sold globally through a number of
major retail outlets, often under the araldite® brand name. in india, our major diy business, we have direct access to the market and strong brand recognition which creates opportunity to
further expand our product offering as we leverage the value of the araldite® brand. 


our
electrical materials are formulated polymer systems, which make up the insulation materials used in equipment for the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical power,
such as transformers, switch gears, ignition coils, sensors, motors and magnets, and for the protection of electrical and electronic devices and components. the purpose of these products is to
insulate, protect or shield either the environment from electrical current or electrical devices from the environment, such as temperature or humidity. our electrical insulating materials target two
key market segments: the heavy electrical equipment market and the light electrical equipment market. 

products
for the heavy electrical equipment market segment are used in power plant components, devices for power grids and insulating parts and components. in addition, there are
numerous devices, such as motors and magnetic coils used in trains and medical equipment, which are manufactured using epoxy and related technologies. products for the light electrical equipment
market segment are used in applications such as industrial automation and control, consumer electronics, automotive electronics and electrical components. the end customers in the electrical
insulating materials market encompass the relevant original equipment manufacturer as well as numerous manufacturers of components used in the final products. we also develop, manufacture and market
materials used in the production of printed circuit boards. our products are ultimately used in industries ranging from telecommunications and personal computer mother board manufacture to automotive
electronic systems manufacture. soldermasks are our most important product line in printed circuit board technologies. sales are made mainly under our probimer® trademark, a widely
recognized brand name in this particular market. 







sales and marketing  

we maintain multiple routes to market to service our diverse customer base. these routes to market range from using our own direct
sales force for targeted, technically-oriented distribution to mass general distribution. our direct sales force focuses on engineering solutions for decision-makers at major customers who purchase
significant amounts of product from us. we use technically-oriented specialist distributors to augment our sales effort in niche markets and applications where we do not believe it is appropriate to
develop direct sales resources. we use mass general distribution channels to sell our products into a wide range of general applications where technical expertise is less important to the user of the
products to reduce our overall selling expenses. we believe our use of multiple routes to market enables us to reach a broader customer base at an efficient cost.

raw materials  

the principal raw materials we purchase for the manufacture of basic and advanced epoxy resins are epichlorohydrin, bisphenol a, blr,
mda and phenol & aminophenols. we also purchase amines, polyols, isocyanates, acrylic materials, hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals
and additives. raw material costs constitute a
sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the 

20




 

table of contents

terms
of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased and formula-based pricing. 


additionally,
we produce large volumes of some of our most important raw materials, such as blr and its basic derivatives, which are the basic building blocks of many of our products.
approximately 65% of the blr we produce is consumed internally in our downstream products. the balance of our blr is sold in the merchant market, allowing us to increase the utilization of our
production plants and lower our overall blr production cost. we believe that manufacturing a large proportion of our principal raw material gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy-based
polymer systems formulators, most of whom must buy blr from third-party suppliers. this position helps protect us from pricing pressure from blr suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of
blr in difficult market conditions. 

we
consume certain amines produced by our performance products segment and isocyanates produced by our polyurethanes segment, which we use to formulate advanced materials products.

textile effects  







general  

our textile effects segment is a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals and dyes in our chosen markets. our textile
solutions enhance the color of finished textiles and improve such performance characteristics as wrinkle resistance and the ability to repel water and stains. our textile effects segment is
characterized by the breadth of our product offering, our long-standing relationships with our customers, our ability to develop and adapt our technology and our applications expertise for new markets
and new applications. 

we
operate synthesis, formulating and production facilities in north america, europe, asia and south america. we market multiple products to customers in multiple end-markets, including
the following: consumer fashion apparel, sportswear, career and uniform apparel, military, automotive, home textiles and furnishings, carpet and other functional textiles. 

during
2011, our textile effects segment began implementing a significant restructuring program, including the closure of our production facilities and business support offices in basel,
switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the segment's long-term global competitiveness and designed to reduce annualized costs by approximately $75 million. in
connection with this program, during 2014, our textile effects segment recorded charges of $19 million, including a $9 million noncash charge for a pension settlement loss. through
december 2014, we have achieved
$88 million of cost savings from this restructuring program. in june 2014, we announced plans for the closure of our qingdao, china plant to be completed by december 2015. during 2014, we
recorded charges of $6 million primarily related to workforce reductions related to this initiative. 








products and markets  

textiles generally involve a complex matrix of fibers, effects and functionality, and the resulting products range from fashion apparel
to bulletproof vests, home linens to carpet, and upholstery to automotive interiors. our broad range of dyestuffs and chemicals enhance both the aesthetic appearance of these products and the
functionality needed to ensure that they perform in their end-use markets. since the requirements for these markets vary dramatically, our business strategy focuses on the three major
markets—apparel, home & institutional and technical textiles. we work to provide the right balance of products and service to meet the technical challenges in each of these markets.
the textile effects business is affected by seasonal holiday closures and typically experiences lower sales in those periods. for example, we typically experience lower sales in asia in the first
quarter as a result of the lunar new year, in europe as a result of the summer holidays, and in the americas and europe during the christmas season at year-end. 

the
apparel market focuses on products that provide an aesthetic effect and/or improve the processing efficiency within the textile mill. we offer a complete range of colors for cotton,
polyester and nylon that cover the range of shades needed for sportswear, intimate apparel, towels, sheeting and casual wear. our dyes have been developed to ensure that they offer the highest levels
of wash fastness currently available in the market. optical brighteners and other pretreatment products provide "bright white" effects for apparel, towels and sheeting. pretreatment and dyeing
auxiliaries ensure that these fabrics are processed efficiently and effectively—cleaning the fabrics with fewer chemicals, less energy and less water and thereby minimizing the
environmental footprint and reducing the processing costs. silicone softeners may be used to enhance the feel of products. 

technical
textiles include automotive textiles, carpet, military fabrics, mattress ticking and nonwoven and other technical fabrics. though the product groups may differ in their end
uses, the articles must provide a high-level of functionality and performance in their respective markets. high-lightfast dyes and uv absorbers are used in automotive interiors and outdoor furnishings
to

provide
colors that don't fade when exposed to sunlight and heat. powerful stain repellent and release technology imparts durable protection for upholstery, military and medical fabrics, without
affecting the
color, breathability or feel of the fabric. specialized dyes and prints create unique camouflage patterns for military uniforms, backpacks and tarps that will not fade through wash and wear or during
exposure to the elements. 







sales and marketing  

for our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. effect
competence—delivering value-added effects to our customer's products—enables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts to
differentiate themselves from competitors. process competence—applying know-how and expertise to improve customers' processes—allows us to utilize our technical service to
reduce cost, enhance efficiency and offer recommendations to improve the ecological and environmental footprint in the wet processing of textiles. 







manufacturing and operations  

we are a global business serving customers in three principal geographic regions: eame, the americas and asia. to service our customers
efficiently, we maintain manufacturing plants around the world with a strategy of global, regional and local manufacturing employed to optimize the level of service and minimize the cost to our
customers. the following table summarizes the plants that we operate:

raw materials  

the manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials (approximately 1,000 different chemicals),
including amines, fluorochemicals and sulfones. no one raw material represents greater than 6% of our textile effects raw material expenditures. raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of
sales for certain applications. we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers. the terms of our supply contracts vary, but, in general, these contracts contain provisions that set forth the
quantities of product to be supplied and purchased. 







competition  

we are a major global solutions provider for textile chemicals and dyes in our chosen markets. competition within the textile chemicals
and dyes markets is generally fragmented with few competitors who offer complete solutions for both markets. our major competitors are achroma (formerly known as clariant), basf, kiri-dystar and
longsheng. we believe that our competitive strengths include our product offering, which is characterized by its broad range; high quality; significant integration between products and service;
reliable technical expertise; long-standing relationships with customers; and strong business infrastructure in asia. we believe that we have more customer service capability and account management
capability than any of our competitors worldwide. 







pigments and additives  








general  

we are a diversified global supplier of pigments and additives. our pigments and additives improve performance and add color to
thousands of everyday items including paints, inks, plastics, concrete, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food. we offer a wide range of products across the color spectrum. our broad product range,
coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. 

we
operate 34 manufacturing facilities. our ten titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities are predominately located in europe and our 18 color pigments manufacturing and processing
facilities are predominately located in the united states. we also operate six facilities producing water treatment, timber treatment chemicals and functional additives. 

on
october 1, 2014, we completed the rockwood acquisition and paid $1.04 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and assumed certain unfunded
pension liabilities. for more information, see "part i. item 1. business—recent
developments—rockwood acquisition." the majority of the acquired businesses have been integrated into our pigments and additives segment. 


in
connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the rockwood acquisition, we sold our tio2 tr52 product line used in printing inks to henan in december
2014. the sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply tr52 product to henan during a transitional period. 

on
december 1, 2014, we announced that we are taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our pigments and additives segment. as part of a comprehensive
restructuring program, we plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 900 positions. annual cost savings are expected to exceed $130 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of
2016. in connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related primarily to workforce reductions. we expect to
record additional restructuring expense
in 2015 once negotiations of employee termination benefits with european works councils are completed.

on
february 12, 2015, we announced plans to reduce our titanium dioxide capacity by approximately 100 kt by closing specific operations at our calais, france facility,
subject to consultation with employees and appropriate representative groups. annual cost savings are expected to be approximately $35 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of
2016. this plan is in addition to that announced on december 1, 2014. 







products and markets  

titanium dioxide.    we are a global leader in the manufacture and marketing of specialty and standard grade titanium dioxide.
titanium dioxide is
derived from titanium bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items including paints, plastics, paper, inks, fibers, food and
personal care products. 

we
own a portfolio of brands including tioxide® and hombitan ranges, such as deltio, altiris, sikovit, granufin, solarox and solaplex, which are produced in our ten
manufacturing facilities around the globe. we service over 2,500 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both
local and global customers, including ampacet, a. schulman, akzonobel, basf, clariant, jotun, polyone, ppg and sun chemical. 


global
titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track gdp growth rates; however, this varies by region. developed markets such as the u.s. and western europe exhibit higher
absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates, while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates. the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales
reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end-use markets. coating sales generally peak during the spring
and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year. 

there
are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide, the sulfate process and the chloride process. we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for
approximately 45% of global production capacity. most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing
route—for example, the inks market prefers sulfate and the automotive coatings market prefers chloride. regional markets typically favor products that are available locally. the sulfate
process produces titanium dioxide in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty applications. 

our
company is one of the five major producers of titanium dioxide in the world. beyond these producers, the titanium dioxide industry currently has a large number of small regional or
local producers, particularly in china. titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks,
efficiency improvements and, more recently, new capacity additions in china. during periods of low titanium dioxide demand, the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces
production to manage working capital. pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply/demand balance. based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning, governmental approvals
and construction, we expect supply additions within the industry for the near term to be in line with historical demand growth. 

we
have an established broad customer base and have successfully differentiated ourselves by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche market segments where the
innovation and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher margins, higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships. we were the first to introduce a zirconia-coated titanium
dioxide pigment to improve the durability of coatings and tioxide® tr92 pigment was the first product to offer our customers flexibility across systems and applications. our experience in
powder flow technology has been applied to develop deltio® free-flow titanium dioxide pigments, offering our customers a

sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through specialty distributors. we sell the majority of our timber treatment
products directly to end customers via viance. 

our
focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. for example, we believe that our pigments and additives segment is well-positioned to
benefit from growth sectors where customers' needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. we maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected
markets. 

much
of our research and development is focused on solutions that address significant emerging trends in the market. 







manufacturing and operations  

our pigments and additives segment has 34 manufacturing facilities operating in ten countries with a total capacity of approximately

(1)this
facility is owned and operated by louisiana pigment company, l.p., a manufacturing joint venture that is owned 50% by us and 50% by kronos. the
capacity shown reflects our 50% interest in louisiana pigment company, l.p.  
 
 





joint venture  

louisiana pigment company, l.p. is our 50%-owned joint venture with kronos. we share production offtake and operating costs of
the plant with kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has
equal representation. our investment in louisiana pigment company, l.p. is accounted for using the equity method. 


viance
is our 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical. viance markets our timber treatment products. our joint venture interest in viance was acquired as part of the rockwood
acquisition on october 1, 2014. the joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our harrisburg, north carolina facility, and we bear a
disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on viance's behalf. as a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary
and began consolidating viance upon the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. 








raw materials  

the primary raw materials used in our pigments and additives segment are titanium-bearing ores and iron oxide particles.

in
recent years, we have purchased the majority of our ores under supply contracts from a range of ore suppliers. the majority of our titanium-bearing ores is sourced from india, africa,
canada and norway. ore accounts for approximately 45% of titanium dioxide variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account
for approximately 30% of variable manufacturing costs. 

the
world market for titanium-bearing ores has an increasing number of small to medium sized suppliers alongside the three largest suppliers (rio tinto, kenmare and iluka) who account
for approximately 40% of global supply between them and from whom we purchase approximately 60% of our needs. as a result of the increasing number of emerging suppliers in recent years, we have
broadened our supply base by purchasing ores from these suppliers. the majority of the
titanium-bearing ores market is now transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume-contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per annum. this form of market-based ore
contracts has introduced more flexibility and responsiveness, both in terms of pricing and quantity obligations. 

titanium
dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process. once an intermediate titanium dioxide
pigment has been produced, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and
chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product's performance characteristics. 


co-products
from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations. in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost
competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products of our pigments and additives segment. we sell over 60% of the co-products generated by our business. 

we
source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from china, the u.s., france and italy. key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from
various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis. 








competition  

the global markets in which our pigments and additives segment operates are highly competitive and vary according to product. 

competition
within the standard grade titanium dioxide market is based on price, product quality and service. the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont, tronox,
kronos and cristal, each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets. if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to
produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete. moreover, the sulfate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments and additives
segment is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture
improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 

competition
within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and, to a certain extent, price. key competitors for
barium-based additives
include solvay s.a., gruppo chimico dalton s.p.a., sakai chemical industry co., ltd. and chinese barium producers. key competitors for zinc-based additives include chinese
lithopone producers. 

competition
within the specialty titanium dioxide market and the color pigments market is based on customer service, product attributes, such as product form and quality, and price.
product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. our primary
competitors within specialty

titanium
dioxide include huierxin, fuj titanium industry, kronos and precheza. our primary competitors within color pigments include lanxess ag, cathay pigments group, interstar materials inc.
and shanghai yipin pigments co., ltd. 

competition
within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology and product range. our primary competitors are lonza group and
osmose inc. 

competition
within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. our primary competitors are kemira and feralco. 







research and development  

for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we spent $158 million, $140 million and $152 million,
respectively, on research and development. 

we
support our business with a major commitment to research and development, technical services and process engineering improvement. our research and development centers are located in
the woodlands, texas; everberg, belgium; and shanghai, china. other regional development/technical service centers are located in wynyard, england and duisburg, germany (pigments); auburn hills,
michigan (polyurethanes for the automotive industry); derry, new hampshire, shanghai, china, deggendorf, germany and ternate, italy (polyurethanes); melbourne, australia (surfactants); port neches,
texas (process engineering support); basel, switzerland and panyu, china (advanced materials and textile effects); and mumbai, india (textile effects). 







intellectual property rights  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. we own
approximately 440 unexpired u.s. patents, approximately 185 patent applications (including provisionals) currently pending at the u.s. patent and trademark office, and approximately 4,380 foreign
issued patents and pending patent applications. while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued u.s. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged,
invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide
meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully
produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. 

we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. there can be no
assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or
proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. in addition, there can be no assurance that
others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 


in
addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to
use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. we also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to
third parties. 

we
have associated brand names with a number of our products, and we have approximately 180 u.s. trademark registrations (including applications for registration currently pending at the
u.s. patent and trademark office), and approximately 4,750 foreign trademark registrations and applications for registration. some of these registrations and applications include filings under the
madrid system for 

31




 

table of contents

the
international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. however, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the
use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. 


because
of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for
which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next
several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 








employees  

as of december 31, 2014, we employed approximately 16,000 people in our operations around the world. approximately 3,000 of
these employees are located in the u.s., while approximately 13,000 are located in other countries. we believe our relations with our employees are good. 







geographic data  

for sales revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see "note 24. operating segment information" to our consolidated
financial statements. 







environmental, health and safety matters  







general  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety,
pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
waste materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in
addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws,
environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some
environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to
modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. 







environmental, health and safety systems  

we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety ("ehs") legal
requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with
applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. although ehs
legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency
and improvement and reducing overall risk to us.

ehs capital expenditures  

we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and
repair pollution control equipment. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled $125 million, $92 million, and
$105 million, respectively. because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of
specific requirements, our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future
amounts we may spend related to ehs and other applicable laws. 

we
have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties
at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. under some
circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 

under
the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla") and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property in the u.s. may
be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable
regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. outside the u.s., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in france and australia, can hold
past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. currently, there are approximately 10 former facilities or third-party sites in the u.s. for which we have been notified of
potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed under cercla. based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites, we do not expect
these third-party claims to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


one
of these sites, the north maybe canyon mine site, involves a former phosphorous mine near soda springs, idaho, which is believed to have been operated by several companies, including
a predecessor company to us. in 2004, the u.s. forest service notified us that we are a cercla potentially responsible party ("prp") for contamination originating from the site. in february 2010, we
and wells cargo (another prp) agreed to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study of a portion of the site and are currently engaged in that process. at this time, we are unable to reasonably
estimate our potential liabilities at this site. 

another
of these sites, the star lake canal site in port neches, tx, involves a discharge point for manufacturing facilities owned by us and several other local chemical manufacturers.
the u.s. environmental protection agency (the "epa") issued a draft consent decree related to cleanup at this site to us and a prior owner in september 2014. the prior owner has an indemnification
obligation and
has accepted defense of this matter. as of december 31, 2014, we had an accrued liability of approximately $18 million relating to this matter and a corresponding receivable of
approximately $18 million relating to our indemnity protection. 

in
addition, under the resource conservation and recovery act ("rcra") in the u.s. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties
as a condition to our hazardous waste permit. some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. we are aware of
soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. for example, our port neches, texas, and geismar,
louisiana, facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements imposed under rcra. similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated,
manufacturing facilities, such as australia, india, france, hungary and italy.

by
letter dated march 7, 2006, our former base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray, australia was issued a cleanup notice by the environmental protection authority
victoria ("epa victoria") due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. on august 23, 2010, epa victoria revoked a second cleanup notice and issued a revised
notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation. as of december 31, 2014, we had an accrued liability of approximately $19 million related to estimated
environmental remediation costs at this site. we can provide no assurance that the authority will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be
required for the cleanup. 

in
many cases, our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility.
in these situations, we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. we have successfully exercised our
rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. we cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such
matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. 


based
on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not
have a material effect on our financial statements. however, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to
such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. at the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to
remediate any of the known contamination sites. 







environmental reserves  

we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known
penalties. liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimates are calculated using present value
techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. the environmental liabilities do not include amounts
recorded as asset retirement obligations. we had accrued $60 million and $27 million for environmental liabilities as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. of these
amounts, $7 million and $5 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $53 million
and $22 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in certain cases, our remediation
liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or
range of such potential excess. 

on
october 1, 2014, the company completed the rockwood acquisition. the properties involved in the transaction are located primarily in china, finland, germany, italy, the united
kingdom and the u.s., and include both owned and leased sites. the existence of soil and groundwater contamination from historical industrial operations is known to exist at some of these new
properties. as of december 31, 2014, these newly acquired businesses had accrued $17 million for environmental liabilities (including remediations, investigations, groundwater
monitoring, and reclamation obligations associated with landfill operations). of this amount, $3 million was classified as accrued liabilities and $14 million was classified as other
noncurrent liabilities. in certain cases, these remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. the company is currently evaluating these new reserve amounts in relation
to similar reserves recorded by the company in the past, as well as within the 

34




 

table of contents

context
of the terms of the acquisition agreements. pursuant to the agreements related to the rockwood acquisition, rockwood has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental matters. 







regulatory developments  

the european union regulatory framework for chemicals, called "reach," became effective in 2007 and is designed to be phased in
gradually over 11 years. as a reach-regulated company that manufactures in or imports more than one metric ton per year of a chemical substance into the european economic area, we were required
to pre-register with the european chemicals agency such chemical substances and isolated intermediates to take advantage of the 11 year phase-in period. to meet our compliance obligations, a
cross-business reach team was established, through which we were able to fulfill all required pre-registrations, our first phase registrations by the november 30, 2010 deadline and our second
phase registrations by the may 31, 2013 deadline. while we continue our registration efforts to meet the next registration deadline of may 31, 2018, our reach implementation team is now
strategically focused on the evaluation and authorization phases of the reach process, directing its efforts to address "substances of very high concern" and evaluating potential business
implications. where warranted, evaluation of substitute chemicals will be an important element of our ongoing manufacturing sustainability efforts. as a chemical manufacturer with global operations,
we are also actively monitoring and addressing analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the european union, such as in korea and taiwan. 


although
the total long-term cost for reach compliance is unknown at this time, we spent approximately $5 million, $4 million and $8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, to meet the initial reach requirements. we cannot provide assurance that these recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts that we may be required to spend for reach compliance. 







greenhouse gas regulation  

globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of "greenhouse gases" ("ghgs"), such as
carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the durban negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol in 2012, a limited group of
nations, including the european union, agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the
european union ghg emissions trading system, established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the european union, continues in its third phase. the european union parliament
continues with a process to formalized "backloading"—the withholding of ghg allowances to prop up carbon prices. in addition, the european union has recently announced its intentions to
cut ghg emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2040 and impose a 27% renewable energy requirement at the european union level. in the u.s., california has commenced the first compliance period of its
cap-and-trade program. in june 2013, china implemented its first pilot carbon emissions exchange in shenzhen, china. pilot carbon emissions schemes have also begun in beijing, shanghai, guangdong, and
tianjin. further
expansion of china's regional cap-and-trade is planned, and ultimately it is expected that these regional systems will form the backbone of a national cap-and-trade program. as these programs have not
been fully implemented and have experienced significant price volatility on low early trading volumes, we are unable at this time to determine their impact on our operations. 

federal
climate change legislation in the u.s. appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will continue to be led by the epa's ghg regulations
and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded
facilities. significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act's (the "caa") prevention of significant deterioration requirements
under the epa's ghg 

35




 

table of contents

"tailoring
rule." some of our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs. 

under
a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the epa is due to propose new source performance standards for ghg emissions from refineries. these standards could
significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. either of these events could have an
adverse effect on our business. 

we
are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and/or european union
emissions trading scheme requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs,
although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission
restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact
of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant
physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our
assets and operations. 







port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the u.s.
department of justice (the "doj") notified us that we were in violation of the caa based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the enforcement
initiative to bring similar actions against refiners and other chemical manufacturers. specifically, the epa alleged violations at our port neches, texas facility from 2007-2012 for flare operations
not consistent with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these findings, the epa referred this matter to the doj. we provided a
formal response to the doj and the epa with a supplemental data submission on april 29, 2013. we have been engaged in discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these alleged violations and
conducted field trials on an alternate flare monitoring method beginning in september 2014. we are currently unable to determine the likelihood or magnitude of potential penalty or injunctive relief
that may be incurred in resolving this matter.

item 1a.    risk factors        








any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.  







risks related to our business  







our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile
economic conditions.  

our financial results are substantially dependent on overall economic conditions in the u.s., europe and asia. declining economic
conditions in all or any of these locations—or negative perceptions about economic conditions—could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could
adversely affect our business. for example, our operations in europe have been impacted by the uncertain european economy, which continues to adversely affect demand for some of our products.
additionally, the weakening of currencies in some emerging countries increases the risk of financial contagion in emerging markets globally.

economic conditions and market instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market
conditions is uncertain, and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time. as a consequence, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on
our financial condition or results of operations. we can give no assurances as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry. 







the markets for many of our products are cyclical and volatile, and we may experience depressed
market conditions for such products.  

historically, the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and profit
margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins. the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes
in the supply and demand for products, changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world. for example, demand for our products depends in part on the housing
and construction industries. these industries are cyclical in nature and have historically been impacted by downturns in the economy. the cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in
significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle. 







planned disruptions in production at our manufacturing facilities and unplanned disruptions, such as
natural disasters, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.  


manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds and outages. any
serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses. alternative
facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, each of which could
negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. long-term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely
affect our profitability. 

unplanned
production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, supply disruptions particularly from sole-source suppliers, strikes,
transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. in addition, many of our
current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas including the u.s. gulf coast, which is subject to hurricanes. a disaster in one of these regions could have a material
impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. 

while
we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances
that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change. in addition, insurance may not
adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or not
available at all. furthermore, some
potential climate-driven losses, particularly inundation due to sea-level rise, may pose long-term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be restored in their current locations.

our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks, including
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes.  

we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the u.s., and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with
international operations. these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could
result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. in addition, we translate our local currency financial results into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during
the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local
currency may translate into fewer u.s. dollars. because we currently have significant operations located outside the u.s., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in
gains or losses on our financial statements. 

other
risks of international operations include trade barriers, tariffs, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic risks and
required compliance with a variety of u.s. and foreign laws, including tax laws, the foreign corrupt practices act (and foreign equivalents), export controls and regulations administered by the office
of foreign assets control. in addition, although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil
sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. furthermore, in foreign jurisdictions where
legal processes may vary from country to country, we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements. in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices vary, we may experience difficulty
collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems. the occurrence of these risks, among others, could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries, which could significantly
affect their ability to make distributions to us. 

we
operate in a significant number of jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the
jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate. in addition, generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap" or "u.s. gaap") have required us to place
valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a significant number of tax jurisdictions. these valuation allowances result from analysis of positive and
negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits. negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre-tax operating losses in specific tax
jurisdictions. changes in valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate. economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of current valuation
allowances and, potentially, the establishment of new valuation allowances. while significant valuation allowances remain, our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant
fluctuations. 







our efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our
strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

we continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change. these initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into
partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new
kinds of risks. we have incurred indebtedness to finance these opportunities, and we may incur additional indebtedness to finance future initiatives. we could also issue additional shares of stock of
the company or our subsidiaries to finance such initiatives. if our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow
demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted. 

39




 


table of contents

the
implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including:



• diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations; 
• requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses;  
• disruptions to important business relationships; 
• increased operating costs; 
• use of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants; and 
• difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter. 


our
inability to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. 







we may have difficulties integrating acquired businesses and as a result, our business, results of
operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

we have completed a number of acquisitions and we will continue to acquire additional businesses and enter into joint ventures as part
of our business strategy. for example, in october 2014, we completed the rockwood acquisition. growth through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks,
including:



• inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired businesses and products;  
• inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures;  
• unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business; 
• difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses; 
• difficulties in realizing projected synergies; and 
• exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability or illegal activities conducted
by an acquired company or a joint venture partner. 


our
inability to address these risks, including with respect to the rockwood acquisition, could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint
ventures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 







if we are unable to execute our cost reduction plans successfully, our total operating costs may be
greater than expected, which may adversely affect our profitability.  

from time to time, we undertake actions to restructure our business segments to improve our earnings profile. we recently announced a
significant restructuring of our pigments and additives segment. we have implemented a number of these programs and have realized a portion of the anticipated benefits. while we continue to search for
opportunities to reduce our costs and expenses to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the effectiveness of our operations, our success in achieving
targeted cost and expense reductions depends
upon a number of factors. if we do not successfully execute on our cost reduction initiatives or if we experience delays in completing the implementation of these initiatives, our results of
operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased
costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could reduce our profitability.  

the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile. we purchase a substantial portion of our
raw materials from third-party suppliers. the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow
price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas feedstocks, which are highly volatile and cyclical. for example, the market for crude oil and natural gas feedstocks has
experienced depressed pricing in recent months, leading to favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchase from third parties. lower raw material prices, however, can lead to downward pressure
on selling prices for certain of our products leading to reduced revenue. any rebound in the pricing for such feedstocks could adversely affect our operating expenses. 


in
general, the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are organic chemical commodity products that are readily available at market prices. we frequently enter into supply
agreements with particular suppliers, but disruptions of existing supply could substantially impact our profitability. if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present
supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the
higher raw materials costs. in addition, if raw materials become unavailable within a geographic area from which they are now sourced, then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective
substitutes. any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues, which could reduce our cash flow. 

our
supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility. while we attempt to match cost increases with
corresponding product price increases, we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. timing differences between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract
product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow. any cost increase that we are not able to pass on
to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







we are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to
adequately protect our critical information technology systems could materially affect our operations.  

we rely on information technology systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain and financial information and
various other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems. information technology system failures,
network disruptions or breaches of security could disrupt our operations, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, processing of transactions
or reporting of financial results. an attack or other problem with our systems could also result in the disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning
our customers or employees, which could result in significant damage to our business and our reputation. 

we
have put in place security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information,
or disruption of our operations. current employees have, and former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our
competitors or otherwise used to harm us. moreover, our operations in certain locations, such as china, may be particularly vulnerable to security attacks or other problems. any breach of our security
measures could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of our information, corruption of data or 

41




 

table of contents

disruption
of operations or transactions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 


in
addition, we could be required to expend significant additional amounts to respond to information technology issues or to protect against threatened or actual security breaches. we
may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the significant risks to our information technology systems. 







our significant debt level, a portion of which is subject to variable interest rates, makes us
vulnerable to downturns and may limit our ability to respond to market conditions or to obtain additional financing.  

we have significant outstanding debt. as of december 31, 2014, our total consolidated outstanding debt was $5,200 million
(including current portion of debt); our debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 73%; our combined outstanding variable rate borrowings were approximately $2.9 billion; and our
current portion of debt totaled $267 million. our debt level, and the fact that a significant percentage of our cash flow is required to make payments on our debt, could have important
consequences for our business, including but not limited to the following:



• we may be more vulnerable to business, industry or economic downturns, making it more difficult to respond to market conditions;  
• cash flow available for other purposes, including the growth of our business, may be reduced;  
• our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained, particularly during periods when the capital markets are unsettled;  
• our competitors with lower debt levels may have a competitive advantage relative to us; and  
• part of our debt is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates (for example, a
1% increase in interest rates, without giving effect to interest rate hedges or other offsetting items, would increase our annual interest rate expense by approximately $29 million). 


our
debt level also impacts our credit ratings. any decision by credit rating agencies to downgrade our debt ratings could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing and could
result in increased interest and other costs. 







agreements governing our debt may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or
to obtain additional financing.  

the agreements governing our debt arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants. these covenants may limit or prohibit our ability
to incur more debt; make certain prepayments of debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; issue stock; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates;
enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate; and transfer or sell assets. some of our strategies may necessitate receiving consents or waivers under our debt arrangements, which
could be withheld. 

our
failure to comply with any of our debt covenants, or our failure to make payments of principal or interest on our debt, could result in a default, or trigger cross-default or
acceleration provisions, under our debt agreements. an event of default could result in our debt obligations becoming immediately due and payable, cause our creditors to terminate their lending
commitments, or force us or one or more of our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. any of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. for more information regarding our debt covenants, see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—compliance with covenants" to our consolidated
financial statements.

the industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete
effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and
major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position in various
products and markets throughout
the world. in addition, some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources,
which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. some of our competitors are owned or partially owned by foreign
governments which may provide a competitive advantage to those competitors. while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes, to improve and
refine existing products and processes, and to develop new applications for existing products, the failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive. moreover,
if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or
obsolete. further, it is possible that we could abandon certain products, processes, or applications due to potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights or that we could be named
in future litigation for the infringement or misappropriation of a competitor's or other third party's intellectual property rights, which could include a claim for injunctive relief and damages, and,
if so, such adverse results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 


certain
of our businesses use technology that is widely available. accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low in certain product segments of our
business, and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing.
further, petroleum-rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand their roles significantly in the future. increased competition in any of our
businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products, which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs, which could reduce our
profitability.  

although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject
to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical products. these hazards include: chemical spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or
hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals. we are also potentially subject to other
hazards, including natural disasters and severe weather; explosions and fires; transportation problems, including interruptions, spills and leaks; mechanical failures; unscheduled downtimes; labor
difficulties; remediation complications; and other risks. many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental
damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace
exposure, exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby, workers' compensation and other matters. 

we
maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance
policies covering other types of risks, including pollution legal liability insurance, but we are not fully insured 

43




 

table of contents

against
all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry
standards and practices. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become
unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings. for more information, see
"—item 3. legal proceedings" below. it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity,
or which may be beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. 







financial difficulties and related problems at our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business
partners could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

during periods of economic disruption, more of our customers than normal may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies,
restructurings and liquidations, which could affect our business by reducing sales, increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability. a significant adverse
change in a customer relationship or in a customer's financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that
customer's receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. in addition, we rely on a number of vendors and suppliers and collaborations with other industry
participants to provide us with chemicals, feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities, that we need to operate our business. during periods of
economic disruption, some of these companies could be forced to reduce their output, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection. if this were to occur, it could adversely affect
their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources or facilities that we need, which could materially disrupt our operations, including the production of certain of our products.
moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. all of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







we are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated
costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection
of the environment and human health and safety, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. actual or
alleged violations of environmental, health and safety, or ehs, laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal
sanctions, as well as, under some ehs laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. 


governmental,
regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory
control with respect to the chemical industry. in addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our reputation,
the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. moreover, changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our
facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability. for
example, our 

44




 

table of contents

operations
are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's
climate. compliance with these regulations and any more stringent restrictions in the future may increase our operational costs. 

we
could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws. capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory
requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations. capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently
anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws. 

furthermore,
we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off-site locations where we disposed of or
arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre-dated our purchase
of our businesses. we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws. 








our operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected by legal claims
against us, including antitrust claims.  

we face risks arising from various legal actions, including matters relating to antitrust, product liability, intellectual property and
environmental claims. over the past few years, antitrust claims have been made against chemical companies, and we have been named as a defendant in the antitrust suits discussed in
"—item 3. legal proceedings—antitrust matters" below. in this type of litigation, the plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, which may be significant. an adverse
outcome in any antitrust claim could be material and significantly impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. 







our business is dependent on our intellectual property. if our intellectual property rights cannot
be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.  

proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business. while a presumption of validity
exists with respect to patents issued to us in the u.s., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. furthermore, if
any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then
our ability to compete may be adversely affected. additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products
in a competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

we
also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. while it is our policy
to enter into agreements imposing confidentiality obligations upon our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, these confidentiality obligations may be breached, may not
provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our trade secrets
and know-how. in addition, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. 

we
may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation
or infringement in
countries where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as
u.s. law. 

45




 

table of contents

the
failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how or the failure of adequate legal
remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 








conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability, particularly in certain
energy-producing nations, along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business.  

conflicts, military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in financial markets. instability
and turmoil, particularly in energy-producing nations, may result in raw material cost increases. the uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of
terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers. accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our
suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

in
addition, a number of governments have instituted regulations attempting to increase the security of chemical plants and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result
in higher operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 







if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make
payment on our debts.  

our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries. because a significant portion
of our operations are conducted by nonguarantor subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of
such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large
extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such nonguarantor subsidiaries. any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our nonguarantor subsidiaries to us
could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in
which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our nonguarantor subsidiaries. in addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent
upon our subsidiaries' earnings. 

our
subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any
funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. any right that we have to
receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds
from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary. 







regulatory or market changes with respect to mtbe may materially reduce our sales and/or materially
increase our costs.  

we produce mtbe, an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of
gasoline. because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies, its use has become controversial in the u.s. and elsewhere, and its use has been effectively eliminated in the u.s. market. we currently
market mtbe, either directly or through third parties, to gasoline additive customers located outside the u.s. this business has been profitable to us over time, and future legislative or regulatory
initiatives outside the u.s. restricting mtbe could materially adversely affect 

46




 

table of contents

our
ability to market and sell mtbe and our profitability. expansion of our po/mtbe operations, including our joint venture with sinopec in china, will further expose us to these risks. 


while
we could use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe, this would require significant capital expenditures to modify our facilities.
moreover, the sale of other products would produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe. 







our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations are currently underfunded, and under certain
circumstances we may have to significantly increase the level of cash funding to some or all of these plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business.  


we have unfunded obligations under our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans and assumed additional unfunded
pension obligations as part of our acquisition of the performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses of rockwood. the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors,
including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable
changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which would reduce the cash available for our business. in addition, a decrease in the
discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future
contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. 

under
the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, the pension benefit guaranty corporation ("pbgc") has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified
pension plan under limited circumstances. in the event our tax-qualified pension plans are terminated by the pbgc, we could be liable to the pbgc for the entire amount of the underfunding and, under
certain circumstances, the liability could be senior to our notes. 







risks related to our common stock and debt securities  







certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a
takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market
value.  

certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, such as a classified board of directors, limitations on
stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire control of our company, even if some of our stockholders were to consider such a change of control to be beneficial. our certificate of
incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. therefore, our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special
voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current
market value. 

47






 



































 



table of contents 







the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the discretion of our board of directors
and limitations under delaware law, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.  

we have a history of paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the
discretion of our board of directors. our board of directors takes into account such matters as general business conditions, our financial results, expected liquidity and capital expenditure
requirements, contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant, and we can
provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. in addition, delaware law contains certain restrictions on a company's ability to pay cash dividends and we can provide
no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods. 







we have purchased, and may continue to purchase, a portion of our debt securities, which could
impact the market for our debt securities and likely would negatively affect our liquidity.  

consistent with past practices, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem our debt securities in open market purchases,

item 3.    legal proceedings        







antitrust matters  

we were named as a defendant in consolidated class action civil antitrust suits filed on february 9 and 12, 2010 in the u.s.
district court for the district of maryland alleging that we and our co-defendants and other alleged co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the u.s. between at least
march 1, 2002 and the present. the other defendants named in this matter were dupont, kronos and cristal (formerly millennium). on august 28, 2012, the court certified a class consisting
of all u.s. customers who purchased titanium dioxide directly from the defendants (the "direct purchasers") since february 1, 2003. we and all other defendants settled the direct purchasers
litigation and the court approved the settlement on december 13, 2013. we paid the settlement in an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. 

on
november 22, 2013, we were named as a defendant in a civil antitrust suit filed in the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota brought by a direct purchaser who opted
out of the direct purchasers class litigation (the "opt-out litigation"). on april 21, 2014, the court severed the claims against us from the other defendants sued and ordered our case
transferred to the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas. subsequently, kronos, another defendant, was also severed from the minnesota case and claims against it were transferred and
consolidated for trial with our case in the southern district of texas. trial is scheduled for february 22, 2016. it is possible that additional claims will be filed by other direct purchasers
who opted out of the class litigation.

table of contents

we
were also named as a defendant in a class action civil antitrust suit filed on march 15, 2013 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california by purchasers
of products made from titanium dioxide (the "indirect purchasers") making essentially the same allegations as did the direct purchasers. on october 14, 2014, plaintiffs filed their second
amended class action complaint narrowing the class of plaintiffs to those merchants and consumers of architectural coatings containing titanium dioxide. plaintiffs have raised state antitrust claims
under the laws of 16 states, consumer
protection claims under the laws of 10 states, as well as unjust enrichment claims under the laws of 20 states. the opt-out litigation and indirect purchasers plaintiffs seek to recover
injunctive relief, treble damages or the maximum damages allowed by state law, costs of suit and attorneys' fees. we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our employees. nevertheless,
we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts which in the aggregate could be material to us. because of the overall complexity of these cases, we are
unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss associated with these claims and we have made no accruals with respect to these claims. 







product delivery claim  

we have been notified by a customer of potential claims related to our alleged delivery of a different product than the one the
customer had ordered. our customer claims that it was unaware that the different product had been delivered until after that product had been used to manufacture materials which were subsequently
sold. originally, the customer stated that it had been notified of claims by its customers of up to an aggregate of €153 million (approximately $187 million) relating to
this matter and claimed that we may be responsible for all or a portion of these potential claims. our customer has since resolved some of these claims and the aggregate amount of the current claims
is now approximately €113 million (approximately $138 million). based on the facts currently available, we believe that we are insured for any liability we may ultimately
have in excess of $10 million. however, no assurance can be given regarding our ultimate liability or costs. we believe our range of possible loss in this matter is between €0
and €113 million (approximately $138 million), and we have made no accrual with respect to this matter. 







indemnification matters  

on july 3, 2012, deutsche bank securities inc. and credit suisse securities (usa) llc (the "banks") demanded that
we indemnify them for claims brought against them by certain matlinpatterson entities that were formerly our stockholders ("matlinpatterson") in litigation filed by matlinpatterson on june 19,
2012 in the 9th district court in montgomery county, texas (the "texas litigation"). the banks assert that they are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the agreement of compromise and
settlement between the banks and our company, dated june 22, 2009, wherein the banks and our company settled claims that we filed relating to the failed acquisition by and merger with hexion.
matlinpatterson claims that the banks knowingly made materially false representations about the nature of the financing for the acquisition of our company by hexion and that they suffered substantial
loss in value to their 19 million shares of our common stock as a result thereof. matlinpatterson is asserting statutory fraud, common law fraud and aiding and abetting statutory fraud and are
seeking actual damages, exemplary damages, costs and attorney's fees and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. on december 21, 2012, the court dismissed the texas
litigation, a decision which was affirmed by the ninth court of appeals of texas on may 15, 2014. a subsequent motion for rehearing by matlinpatterson was denied by the same appellate court on
june 12, 2014. a petition for discretionary review in the texas supreme court was filed on july 28, 2014 and is currently pending. 

on
july 14, 2014, the banks demanded that we indemnify them for additional claims brought against them by certain other former company stockholders in litigation filed
june 14, 2014 in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin (the "wisconsin litigation"). the stockholders in the wisconsin litigation have made essentially the same
allegations as matlinpatterson

made
in the texas litigation and, additionally, have named apollo global management llc and apollo management holdings, l.p. as defendants. stockholder plaintiffs in the wisconsin
litigation assert claims for misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud. on december 23, 2014, the banks filed motions to dismiss the wisconsin litigation on the same grounds asserted in the
texas litigation. the court has not ruled on these motions. we denied the banks' indemnification demand for both the texas litigation and the wisconsin litigation. 







port neches flaring matter  

as part of the epa's national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated october 12, 2012, the doj
notified us that we were in violation of the caa based on our response to a 2010 caa section 114 information request. the epa has used the enforcement initiative to bring similar actions
against refiners and other chemical manufacturers. specifically, the epa alleged violations at our port neches, texas facility from 2007-2012 for flare operations not consistent with good pollution
control practice and not in compliance with certain flare-related regulations. as a result of these findings, the epa referred this matter to the doj. we provided a formal response to the doj and the
epa with a supplemental data submission on april 29, 2013. we have been engaged in discussions with the doj and the epa regarding these alleged violations and conducted field trials on an
alternate flare monitoring method beginning in september 2014. we are currently unable to determine the likelihood or magnitude of potential penalty or injunctive relief that may be incurred in
resolving this matter. 







other proceedings  

we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under
provisions of applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these
matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

 
item 4.    mine safety disclosures        

not applicable.

dividends  

during the quarters ended december 31, 2014 and september 30, 2014, we paid cash dividends of $30 million and
$31 million, respectively, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders, and during each of the quarters ended june 30, 2014 and march 31, 2014, we paid cash dividends of
$30 million, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders for a total of $121 million of cash dividends paid during 2014. during each quarter of 2013, we paid cash dividends of
$30 million, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders for a total of $120 million of cash dividends paid during 2013. the payment of dividends is a business decision made by our board
of directors from time to time based on our earnings, financial position and prospects, and such other considerations as our board of directors considers relevant. accordingly, while management
currently expects that the company will continue to pay the quarterly cash dividend, its dividend practice may change at any time.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations        







overview  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our products comprise a
broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those
in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power
generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride,
epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. our administrative, research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the
facilities listed in "part i. item 2. properties" above, which are located in more than 30 countries. we employed approximately 16,000 associates worldwide at december 31, 2014. 

we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced
materials and textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces primarily inorganic chemical products. in a series of
transactions beginning in 2006, we have sold or shut down substantially all of our former australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations. we report the
results from these businesses as discontinued operations. 

growth
in our polyurethanes and advanced materials segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications, as
well as by the level of global economic activity. historically, demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth. in polyurethanes, this growth, driven largely by asia, has
in recent years resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products, including mdi. mdi does, however, experience some seasonality in its sales
reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets. sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the
second and third quarters of the year. 

in
our performance products segment, demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp, as overall demand is significantly influenced by
new product and application development. demand for most of our performance intermediates has grown in line with gdp growth. over time, demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that
slightly exceed gdp growth. however, maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical given its dependence on the upr market, which is influenced by construction end markets. 

demand
in our textile effects segment is driven primarily by consumer activity. consumer spending for goods incorporating our textile effects products is impacted significantly by a wide
range of economic
factors, including personal incomes, housing and energy prices and other highly volatile factors. accordingly, demand for our textile effects products has been volatile and appears likely to remain
volatile. 

historically,
demand for titanium dioxide pigments and additives has grown at rates approximately equal to gdp growth. pigment prices have historically reflected industry-wide operating
rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product

table of contents

stocking
and destocking by customers and producers, contract arrangements and seasonality. the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints, the largest end use for
titanium dioxide, generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere. this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year. 

for
further information regarding sales price and demand trends, see "results of operations—segment analysis—year ended december 31, 2014 compared to year
ended december 31, 2013" and the tables captioned "year ended december 31, 2014 vs. 2013, period-over-period increase (decrease)" and "fourth quarter 2014 vs. third quarter 2014,
period-over-period increase (decrease)" below. 








outlook  

our differentiated businesses that include mdi urethanes, performance products, advanced materials and textile effects have an
attractive growth profile and we expect profitability to continue to improve during 2015. 

we
have a number of initiatives underway that will improve the competitiveness and strength of our entire company and we are investing in growth projects that will improve our businesses
over the next few years. we are taking aggressive action to deliver synergies as we integrate the businesses we purchased from rockwood. 


our
earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate movements. our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies, including the primary european currencies which
have recently
been volatile, while our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. generally, a decline in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar, will reduce the reported profitability of our polyurethanes,
performance products, advanced materials and pigments and additives segments. a decline in the value of the pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar will increase the reported profitability of our
pigments and additives segment and an increase in the value of the swiss franc relative to the u.s. dollar will reduce the reported profitability of our advanced materials and textile effects
segments. we are also exposed to other foreign currencies including the chinese renminbi, the indian rupiah, the brazilian real and the thai baht. in general, a decline in the value of these
currencies as compared to the u.s. dollar will reduce our reported profitability. 

notwithstanding
near term headwinds and shocks to the business landscape, such as meaningful movements in foreign currency rates and lower priced oil, we believe we are well positioned
to deliver increased earnings, an improvement in free cash flow and increased stockholder value over the next several years. the following is a summary of the key trends expected in our business
segments: 







polyurethanes: 



• strong mdi demand in the u.s. and asia, modest demand in europe 
• improving mdi margins 
• lower benzene raw material costs 
• lower po/mtbe margins 
• po/mtbe maintenance outage in the first quarter 2015, approximate $60 million ebitda impact and $90 million maintenance
cost 








performance products: 



• benefits of european surfactants restructuring expected in 2015 
• improving downstream product margins

table of contents



• singapore polyetheramine facility expansion in mid-2016 
• lower oil prices reduces u.s. gulf coast manufacturing advantage 








advanced materials: 



• strong aerospace market 








textile effects: 



• selective growth above underlying market demand 
• progressive environmental regulations impacting raw materials costs 








pigments and additives: 



• approximately $130 million of synergies from integration of former rockwood businesses  
• approximately $35 million of cost savings from planned titanium dioxide capacity rationalization in calais, france  
• improving sales prices 


we
expect to spend approximately $625 million in 2015 on capital expenditures, net of reimbursements, for growth initiatives, maintenance and restructuring. 

we
expect our full year 2015 adjusted effective income tax rate to be in the low 30%s. we believe our long-term effective income tax rate will be approximately 30%.

is defined as net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, before interest, income taxes, depreciation
and amortization. because ebitda excludes these items, ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings, fluctuations in interest rates or
effective tax rates, or levels of depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is computed by eliminating the following from ebitda: (a) acquisition and integration expenses and purchase
accounting adjustments; (b) loss on initial consolidation of subsidiaries; (c) ebitda from discontinued operations; (d) gain on disposition of businesses/assets; (e) loss
on early extinguishment of debt; (f) extraordinary gain on the acquisition of a business; (g) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (h) amortization of pension and
postretirement actuarial losses; and (i) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs. we believe that net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman
international, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda.

we
believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda supplement an investor's understanding of our financial performance. however, these measures should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes
for net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with gaap. moreover, ebitda and adjusted ebitda
as used herein are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. our management believes these
measures are useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also used by securities analysts,
lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because they exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. for
example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among
companies. in addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in
which they operate. as a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods
of acquiring and depreciating such assets. this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. 

nevertheless,
our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income
attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance. for example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and
interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda and adjusted ebitda by using these measures to
supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than gaap results alone.  


in
addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe it is
useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific
underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating
results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. for example, while ebitda from discontinued operations is a
recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.  



(2)adjusted
net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to huntsman corporation or
huntsman international, as appropriate: (a) acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting adjustments; (b) impact of certain foreign tax credit elections; (c) loss
on initial consolidation of subsidiaries; (d) loss from discontinued operations; (e) discount amortization on settlement financing; (f) gain on disposition of businesses/assets;
(g) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (h) extraordinary gain on the acquisition of a business; (i) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (j) amortization of
pension and postretirement actuarial losses; and (k) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and

transition
costs. the income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense,
computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. we do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful
information than is provided under gaap. basic adjusted income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period. diluted adjusted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities.  

adjusted
net income and adjusted income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental disclosures to net income applicable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate,
and income per share because we believe that these measures are indicative of our operating performance. these measures are also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of
different companies because they exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. nevertheless, our management
recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted net income and adjusted income per share in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income attributable to
huntsman corporation or huntsman international, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance for example, adjusted net income and adjusted income per share exclude items that may be
recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. however, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and
trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate
specifically to current operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. for example, while loss (gain)
from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.

cost associated with the transition of our textile effects segment's production from basel, switzerland to a tolling facility. these costs were
included in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations. additionally, includes costs associated with a reorganization of our global information technology organization.
(4)capital
expenditures, net of reimbursements, represent cash paid for capital expenditures less payments received as reimbursements from customers and joint
venture partners. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, capital expenditures of $601 million, $471 million and $412 million, respectively, were reimbursed in part by $37 million,
$4 million and $4 million, respectively.

year ended december 31, 2014 compared with year ended december 31, 2013  

for the year ended december 31, 2014, net income attributable to huntsman corporation was $323 million on revenues of
$11,578 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman corporation of $128 million on revenues of $11,079 million for 2013. for the year ended december 31,
2014, net income attributable to huntsman international was $335 million on revenues of $11,578 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman international of
$126 million on revenues of $11,079 million for 2013. the increase of $195 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the increase of $209 million in
net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



• revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $499 million, or 5%, as compared with 2013. the increase was
due principally to higher average selling prices in our performance products, advanced materials and textile effects segments and higher sales volumes in our polyurethanes and pigments and additives
segments. see "—segment analysis" below. 
• our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by
$166 million and $157 million, respectively, or 9% each, as compared with 2013. the increase resulted from higher gross margins in all our segments, except for our pigments and additives
segment. see "—segment analysis" below. 
• operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by $36 million and $37 million, respectively,
or 3% each, as compared with 2013, primarily related to higher acquisition and integration costs and higher foreign currency losses. 
• restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased to $158 million from
$151 million in 2013. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• our interest expense and the interest expense of huntsman international for 2014 increased by $15 million and
$11 million, respectively, or 8% and 5%, respectively, as compared with 2013. the increase was due primarily to additional borrowings in 2014 that were used to fund the rockwood acquisition.  
• loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to $28 million from
$51 million in 2013. the loss in 2014 resulted from the redemption of our 2020 senior subordinated notes. the loss in 2013 resulted primarily from the repurchase of the remainder of our 5.50%
senior notes due 2016 ("2016 senior notes"). for more information, see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of
debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 
• our income tax expense decreased and the income tax expense of huntsman international decreased by $74 million and
$94 million, respectively, as compared with 2013, primarily due to the benefit of utilizing u.s. foreign tax credits, which had been subject to a valuation allowance. excluding the impact of
the u.s. foreign tax credits, our income tax expense increased and the income tax expense of huntsman international increased by $40 million and $41 million, respectively, as compared
with 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2014, excluding the impact of the benefit of our u.s. foreign tax credits, our effective tax rate was 39%, which is lower than our effective tax rate
of 45% for 2013, primarily due to various valuation allowance releases in 2014 and because our textile effects segment's restructuring charges in 2013 received nominal tax benefit. our tax expense is
significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. for further
information concerning taxes, see "note 17. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the increase in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved
sales mix, partially offset by lower average selling prices. mdi sales volumes increased due to improved demand in the americas and asian regions and across most major markets. po/mtbe sales volumes
decreased primarily as a result of two manufacturing disruptions at our port neches, texas facility in the second and third quarters of 2014. po/mtbe average selling prices decreased primarily due to
less favorable market conditions. mdi average selling prices increased in the americas and european regions, partially offset by lower component pricing in china. the decrease in segment ebitda was
primarily due to lower po/mtbe earnings, partially offset by higher mdi sales margins. during 2014 and 2013, our polyurethanes segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of
$19 million and $2 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our
consolidated financial statements.

changes
in sales mix. average selling prices increased in response to higher raw material costs and continued strong market conditions for amines, maleic anhydride and specialty surfactants. sales
volumes decreased primarily due to a decline in sales volumes of surfactants, which resulted from the restructuring of our european surfactants business, partially offset by an increased demand for
amines and maleic anhydride. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to the impact of our
scheduled maintenance in the first quarter of 2013, estimated at $55 million, and increased margins in amines and maleic anhydride, partially offset by higher restructuring charges. during 2014
and 2013, our performance products segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $28 million and $18 million, respectively. for more information concerning
restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower sales volumes,
partially offset by higher average selling prices and improved sales mix. sales volumes decreased primarily in our coatings and construction market due to our restructuring efforts, partially offset
by higher demand in the wind market in the americas and asia pacific regions. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we closed two of our base resins production units as we focus on higher value markets,
such as aerospace and transportation and industrial. during 2014, we also experienced an unplanned production outage due to a raw materials supply disruption in the americas region. average selling
prices increased in all regions and across most markets primarily due to certain price increase initiatives and a focus on higher value markets. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to
higher margins, improved sales mix, lower restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and lower selling, general and administrative costs as a result of recent restructuring efforts. during 2014
and 2013, our advanced materials segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $11 million and $34 million, respectively. for more information concerning
restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







textile effects  

the increase in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher average selling prices,
partially offset by lower sales volumes. average selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material costs. sales volumes decreased primarily due to the de-selection of lower value
business. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher margins, lower manufacturing costs and lower restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs, partially offset by
higher selling, general and administrative costs. during 2014 and 2013, our textile effects segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs of $28 million and
$87 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial
statements. 







pigments and additives  

the increase in revenues in our pigments and additives segment for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the impact of the
rockwood acquisition. other than the impact of the rockwood acquisition, sales volumes remained flat as a result of higher end-use demand in the european and north american regions, offset by lower
demand in the africa, latin america and middle east regions. average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of high industry inventory levels, partially offset by the strength of the euro
against the u.s. dollar. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins, higher acquisition expenses and integration costs and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by lower
selling, general and administrative costs. during 2014 and

table of contents

2013,
our pigments and additives segment recorded acquisition expenses and integration costs of $43 million and $8 million, respectively. during 2014 and 2013, our pigments and additives
segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $60 million and $4 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see
"note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 








corporate and other  

corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, last-in first-out ("lifo")
inventory valuation reserve adjustments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unallocated restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, nonoperating income and expense, benzene sales and gains
and losses on the disposition of corporate assets. for 2014, ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman corporation increased by $33 million to a loss of $228 million from a loss of
$261 million for 2013. for 2014, ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman international increased by $32 million to a loss of $230 million from a loss of $262 million
for 2013. the increase in ebitda from corporate and other resulted primarily from a decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt of $23 million ($28 million loss in 2014 compared to
$51 million loss in 2013). for more information regarding the loss on early extinguishment of debt, see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of
notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements. the increase in ebitda also resulted from a $7 million decrease in loss from benzene sales (nil in 2014
compared to $7 million loss in 2013), a $6 million decrease in restructuring, impairment and plant
closing costs ($13 million of expense in 2014 compared to $19 million of expense in 2013) and a decrease in legal settlements of $5 million (nil in 2014 compared to
$5 million of expense in 2013). for more information concerning restructuring activities see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial
statements. the increase in ebitda was partially offset by an increase in unallocated foreign exchange losses of $5 million ($5 million loss in 2014 compared to nil in 2013) and an
increase in global information technology transition costs of $3 million ($3 million of expense in 2014 compared to nil in 2013). 







discontinued operations  

the operating results of our former polymers, base chemicals and australian styrenics businesses are classified as discontinued
operations, and, accordingly, the revenues of these businesses are excluded from revenues for all periods presented. the ebitda of these former businesses are included in discontinued operations for
all periods presented. the loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results, legal costs, restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and gain (loss) on disposal with respect
to our former businesses. 







year ended december 31, 2013 compared with year ended december 31, 2012  

for the year ended december 31, 2013, the net income attributable to huntsman corporation was $128 million on revenues of
$11,079 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman corporation of $363 million on revenues of $11,187 million for 2012. for the year ended december 31,
2013, the net income attributable to huntsman international was $126 million on revenues of $11,079 million, compared with net income attributable to huntsman international of
$365 million on revenues of $11,187 million for 2012. the decrease of $235 million in net income attributable to huntsman corporation and the decrease of $239 million in
net income attributable to huntsman international was the result of the following items:



• revenues for 2013 decreased by $108 million, or 1%, as compared with 2012. the decrease was due principally to lower average
selling prices in our pigments and additives segment and lower sales volumes in our performance products and advanced materials segments. see "—segment analysis" below.

table of contents



• our gross profit and the gross profit of huntsman international for 2013 decreased by $281 million and $271 million,
respectively, or 14% and 13%, respectively, as compared with 2012. the decrease resulted from lower gross margins in our polyurethanes and pigments and additives segments. see "—segment
analysis" below. 
• restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for 2013 increased to $151 million from $92 million in 2012. for more
information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• our interest expense and the interest expense of huntsman international for 2013 decreased by $36 million and
$35 million, respectively, or 16% and 15%, respectively, as compared with 2012. the decrease was due primarily to the reduction in noncash interest expense resulting from the repayment of our
2016 senior notes in 2012 and 2013. 
• loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2013 decreased to $51 million from $80 million in 2012. in 2012, we recorded a
loss on early extinguishment of debt of $80 million primarily from the repurchase of a portion of our 2016 senior notes. in 2013, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of
$34 million primarily from the repurchase of the remainder of our 2016 senior notes and $17 million primarily related to the repayment of our term loan c facility ("term loan c"). for
more information, see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• our income tax expense decreased by $44 million to an expense of $125 million for 2013 as compared with an expense of
$169 million for 2012. huntsman international's income tax expense decreased by $42 million to an expense of $137 million for 2013 as compared with an expense of
$179 million for 2012. our and huntsman international's tax obligations are affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. our 2013 effective tax rate is
significantly impacted by losses in tax jurisdictions where we have a full valuation allowance. for more information, see "note 17. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.

polyurethanes  

the increase in revenues in our polyurethanes segment for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher sales volumes. mdi sales
volumes increased in the americas and asia pacific regions, partially offset by lower volumes in the european region. european sales volumes were lower primarily as a result of a force majeure event
that caused an extended outage at our rotterdam, the netherlands' mdi facility in the second quarter of 2013. po/mtbe sales volumes decreased due to weaker market demand. mdi average selling prices
increased in all regions primarily in response to higher raw material costs, offset by a decrease in po/mtbe average selling prices primarily due to less favorable market conditions. the 2013 decrease
in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower po/mtbe earnings (in 2012, first and third quarter ebitda benefited from industry supply outages) and lower mdi margins in the european region as a result
of the rotterdam mdi facility outage during the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by increased mdi margins in the americas and asia pacific regions. during 2013 and 2012, our polyurethanes
segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $2 million and $38 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring activities, see
"note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







performance products  

the decrease in revenues in our performance products segment for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower sales volumes. the
decrease in sales volumes resulted from the impact of the scheduled maintenance on our olefins and ethylene oxide facilities in port neches, texas in the first quarter of 2013, which more than offset
increases in amines and maleic anhydride sales volumes. excluding the impact of this scheduled maintenance, sales volumes would have increased by approximately 4%. average selling prices increased in
amines and maleic anhydride offset by the mix effect of a higher level of toll business in 2013. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to improved sales volumes and margins in maleic
anhydride and amines, partially offset by the impact of our scheduled maintenance, estimated at $55 million, and higher restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs. during 2013 and 2012,
our performance products segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $18 million and $1 million, respectively. for more information concerning restructuring
activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.

table of contents







advanced materials  

the decrease in revenues in our advanced materials segment for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower sales volumes,
partially offset by higher average selling prices. sales volumes decreased in our base resins business in all regions due to reduced available output which resulted from the permanent closure of some
production lines and over supply. in our specialty component business, sales volumes decreased in all regions in the coatings and construction and wind markets, offset in part by higher sales volumes
in the aerospace markets in the americas and european regions. sales volumes also decreased in our formulations business in the americas and european regions, primarily in the wind and electrical and
electronics markets, offset in part by higher sales volumes in the asia pacific region marine market and in the africa middle east region electrical and electronics market. average selling prices
increased in the european region, primarily in response to higher raw material costs and increased focus on higher value component and formulations sales, partially offset by decreases in average
selling prices in our asia pacific formulations business and in our americas base resins business due to increased competition. the increase in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower restructuring,
impairment and plant closing costs and lower selling, general and administrative costs as a result of recent restructuring efforts, partially offset by lower sales volumes and lower margins. during
2013 and 2012, our advanced materials segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $34 million and $38 million, respectively. for more information concerning
restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







textile effects  

the increase in revenues in our textile effects segment for 2013 compared to 2012 was due to higher sales volumes and higher average
selling prices. sales volumes increased primarily due to increased market share in key countries. average selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material costs, offset in part by
the strength of the u.s. dollar against major international currencies. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to higher restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs and
higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs as a result of our restructuring efforts and higher sales volumes. during 2013 and
2012, our textile effects segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs of $87 million and $26 million, respectively. for more information concerning
restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







pigments and additives  

the decrease in revenues in our pigments and additives segment for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower average selling
prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. average selling prices decreased in all regions of the world primarily as a result of high industry inventory levels. sales volumes increased in all
regions primarily due to higher end-use demand. the decrease in segment ebitda was primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by lower manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs
as a result of our restructuring efforts. during 2013 and 2012, our pigments and additives segment recorded restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs of $4 million each. for more
information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements.

sales and gains and losses on the disposition of corporate assets. for 2013, ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman corporation decreased by $10 million to a loss of
$261 million from a loss of $251 million for 2012. for 2013, ebitda from corporate and other for huntsman international decreased by $11 million to a loss of $262 million
from a loss of $251 million for 2012. the decrease in ebitda from corporate and other resulted primarily from a $17 million decrease in income from benzene sales ($7 million of
loss in 2013 compared to $10 million of income in 2012), a $13 million decrease in lifo inventory valuation income ($1 million of income in 2013 compared to $14 million of
income in 2012) and a $17 million increase in restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs ($19 million of expense in 2013 compared to $2 million of expense in 2012). for
more information concerning restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. the decrease in ebitda was
partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation of $6 million and a decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt of $29 million ($51 million of loss in 2013 compared
to $80 million of loss in 2012). for more information regarding the loss on early extinguishment of debt, see "note 13. debt—direct and
subsidiary debt—redemption of notes and loss on early extinguishment of debt" to our consolidated financial statements. 







discontinued operations  

the operating results of our former polymers, base chemicals and australian styrenics businesses are classified as discontinued
operations, and, accordingly, the revenues of these businesses are excluded from revenues for all periods presented. the ebitda of these former businesses are included in discontinued operations for
all periods presented. the loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results, legal costs, restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and gain (loss) on disposal with respect
to our former businesses. 







liquidity and capital resources  

the following is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources and generally does not include separate information with respect
to huntsman international in accordance with general instruction i of form 10-k. 







cash flows for year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended
december 31, 2013  

net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 and 2013 was $760 million and $708 million, respectively. the increase
in net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in net income as described in "—results of operations" above, offset
in part by a $61 million unfavorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2014 as compared with 2013. 

net
cash used in investing activities for 2014 and 2013 was $1,606 million and $566 million, respectively. during 2014 and 2013, we paid $601 million and
$471 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. during 2014, we paid $1.04 billion for rockwood's performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses and during 2013 we paid
$66 million for the acquisition of businesses. during 2014 and 2013, we made investments in louisiana pigment company, l.p. of $37 million and $60 million, respectively,
and in nanjing jinling huntsman new materials co., ltd of $62 and $37 million, respectively, and we received dividends from louisiana pigment company, l.p. of
$48 million and $71 million, respectively. 

net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2014 and 2013 was $1,197 million and $(6) million, respectively. the increase in net cash provided by financing activities
was due to higher net borrowings during 2014, primarily used to fund the rockwood acquisition, as compared to 2013.

cash flows for year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended
december 31, 2012  

net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 and 2012 was $708 million and $774 million, respectively. the decrease
in net cash provided by operating activities during year ended december 31, 2013 compared with the same period in 2012 was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income as described
in "—results of operations" above, offset in part by a $123 million favorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for 2013 as compared with 2012. 

net
cash used in investing activities for 2013 and 2012 was $566 million and $471 million, respectively. during 2013 and 2012, we paid $471 million and
$412 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. during 2013 and 2012, we made investments in louisiana pigment company, l.p. of $60 million and $100 million,
respectively, and in our nanjing jinling joint venture of $37 million and $24 million, respectively, and received dividends from our unconsolidated joint ventures, louisiana pigment
company, l.p. and basf huntsman shanghai isocyanate investment b.v., of $71 million and $82 million, respectively. during 2013 and 2012, we paid $66 million and
$18 million, respectively, for the acquisitions of businesses. 

net
cash used in financing activities for 2013 and 2012 was $6 million and $473 million, respectively. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily
due to lower net repayments of debt during 2013 as compared to 2012, offset in part by an increase in dividends paid to common stockholders.

table of contents
 
 

excluding
the effects of the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014, our working capital increased by $164 million as a result of the net impact of the following significant
changes:


• the increase in cash and cash equivalents of $262 million resulted from the matters identified on our consolidated statements
of cash flows. 
• accounts and notes receivable decreased by $113 million mainly due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding
sales from the acquired rockwood businesses, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. 
• inventories decreased by $116 million mainly due to lower raw material costs offset in part by an increase in inventory levels
in anticipation of scheduled maintenance outages at certain manufacturing facilities during the first quarter of 2015. 
• other current assets increased by $72 million mainly due to increases in income taxes receivable and the value of
cross-currency interest rate contracts. 
• accrued liabilities decreased by $58 million mainly due to decreases in accrued taxes other than income, income taxes payable
and accrued rebates, offset in part by an increase in accrued restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs.  

 
 





direct and subsidiary debt  

huntsman corporation's direct debt and guarantee obligations consist of a guarantee of certain indebtedness incurred from time to time
to finance certain insurance premiums. substantially all of our other debt, including the facilities described below, has been incurred by our subsidiaries (primarily huntsman international); huntsman
corporation is not a guarantor of such subsidiary debt. 

certain
of our subsidiaries are designated as nonguarantor subsidiaries and have third-party debt agreements. these debt agreements contain certain restrictions with regard to dividends,
distributions, loans or advances. in certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to us. 







senior credit facilities  

as of december 31, 2014, our senior credit facilities ("senior credit facilities") consisted of our revolving credit facility
("revolving facility"), our extended term loan b facility ("extended term loan b"), our extended term loan b facility—series 2 ("extended term loan
b—series 2"), our 2014 new term loan facility ("2014 new term loan"), and term loan c as follows (dollars in millions):

weighted average interest rate on our outstanding balances under the senior credit facilities was approximately 3%.  
 
our
obligations under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and certain of our foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the
"guarantors"), and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic property, plant and equipment, the stock of all of our material domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign
subsidiaries, and pledges of intercompany notes between certain of our subsidiaries. 







amendment to the credit agreement  

on october 15, 2013, huntsman international entered into a tenth amendment to the agreement governing the senior credit
facilities (the "credit agreement"). the amendment, among other things, permitted us to incur a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion, the 2014 new
term loan, and to increase our revolving facility. in august 2014, we entered into the eleventh and twelfth amendments, which modified the credit agreement to initially fund the 2014 new term loan
into escrow and completed the increase of our revolving facility by $200 million. 

on
october 1, 2014, the 2014 new term loan was used to fund the rockwood acquisition. see "note 3. business combinations and dispositions—rockwood acquisition."
the 2014 new term loan matures on october 1, 2021 and will amortize in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the 2014 new term loan, payable quarterly
commencing march 31, 2015. the 2014 new term loan bears interest at an interest rate margin of libor plus 3.00% (subject to a 0.75% floor). the 2014 new term loan was recorded at a carrying
value of $1,188 million as of october 1, 2014. 

on
october 1, 2014, huntsman international entered into a further amendment to the credit agreement. the amendment increased revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount
of $25 million to an aggregate amount of $625 million. 







a/r programs  

our u.s. accounts receivable securitization program ("u.s. a/r program") and our european accounts receivable securitization program
("eu a/r program" and collectively with the u.s. a/r program, "a/r programs") are structured so that we grant a participating undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables to a u.s.
special purpose entity ("u.s. spe") and a european special purpose entity ("eu spe"). we retain the servicing rights and a retained interest
in the securitized receivables. information regarding our a/r programs as of december 31, 2014 was as follows (monetary amounts in millions):

interest. 

on
june 2, 2014, pursuant to an indenture entered into on december 23, 2013, huntsman international issued €145 million (approximately
$197 million) aggregate principal amount of additional 2021 senior notes. the additional notes are recorded at carrying value €149 million (approximately

indebtedness of nonguarantor subsidiaries, enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to any principal properties and consolidate or merge with or into any other person or lease, sell or
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets. upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, holders of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 senior notes will have the right to require
that huntsman international purchase all or a portion of such holder's notes in cash at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
repurchase.

variable interest entity debt  

as of december 31, 2014, arabian amines company had $158 million outstanding under its loan commitments and debt
financing arrangements. arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, is currently not in compliance with payment and other obligations under these loan commitments. we do not
guarantee these loan commitments and arabian amines company is not a guarantor of any of our other debt obligations, and the noncompliance with these financial covenants does not affect any of our
other debt obligations. we are currently in discussions with the lenders under these loan commitments and expect to resolve the noncompliance. as of december 31, 2014, the amounts outstanding
under these loan commitments were classified as current on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

as
of december 31, 2014, sasol-huntsman, our consolidated 50%-owned venture has €40 million (approximately $49 million) outstanding under the term
loan facility. the
facility will be repaid over semiannual installments with the final repayment scheduled for december 2018. obligations under the facility agreement are secured by, among other things, first priority
right on the property, plant and equipment of sasol-huntsman. 







note payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation  

as of december 31, 2014, we have a loan of $750 million to our subsidiary, huntsman international (the "intercompany
note"). the intercompany note is unsecured and $100 million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december 31, 2014 on our consolidated balance sheets. as of
december 31, 2014, under the terms of the intercompany note, huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly
average borrowing rate obtained under our u.s. accounts receivable securitization program ("u.s. a/r program"), less 10 basis points (provided that the rate shall not exceed an amount that is 25 basis
points less than the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the u.s. libor-based borrowings under our revolving facility). 







compliance with covenants  

we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including
our senior credit facilities, our a/r programs and our notes. however, arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, is currently not in compliance with certain financial covenants
contained under its loan commitments. see "—variable interest entity debt" above. 

our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the 

82




 

table of contents

underlying
debt obligations immediately due and payable. furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a failure to
comply with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement. 

our
senior credit facilities are subject to a single financial covenant (the "leverage covenant") which applies only to the revolving facility and is calculated at the huntsman
international level. the leverage covenant is applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or
guarantees are not deemed outstanding). the leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international's ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda (as
defined in the applicable agreement) is not more than 3.75 to 1. 

if
in the future huntsman international fails to comply with the leverage covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility. if huntsman international
failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility, huntsman international would be in default under
the senior credit facilities, and, unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), huntsman international could
be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities. 

the
agreements governing our a/r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. any material failure to meet the applicable a/r programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the a/r programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the a/r programs in full. an early termination event under the a/r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit
facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities.

short-term and long-term liquidity  

we depend upon our cash, credit facilities, a/r programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working
capital needs. as of december 31, 2014, we had $1,601 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity, consisting of $870 million in cash and restricted cash,
$609 million in availability under our revolving facility, and $122 million in availability under our a/r 

83




 

table of contents

programs.
our liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors. the following matters had, or are expected to have, a significant impact on our
liquidity:



• cash invested in our accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable, decreased by approximately $68 million for
2014, as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. we expect volatility in our working capital components to continue. 
• during 2015, we expect to spend approximately $625 million on capital expenditures, net of reimbursements, including
approximately $100 million combined for our new mdi facility, the completion of the augusta, georgia color pigments facility and replacement of rockwood computer systems. our future
expenditures include certain ehs maintenance and upgrades; periodic maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities; expansions of our existing facilities or construction
of new facilities; certain cost reduction projects; and certain information technology expenditures. we expect to fund this spending with cash provided by operations.  
• during 2014, we made contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans of $159 million. during 2015, we expect to
contribute an additional amount of approximately $101 million to these plans. 
• we are also involved in a number of cost reduction programs for which we have established restructuring accruals. as of
december 31, 2014, we had $138 million of accrued restructuring costs from continuing operations, and we expect to incur and pay additional restructuring and plant closing costs of up to
approximately $150 million in 2015. 


on
december 1, 2014, we announced that we are taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our pigments and additives segment. as part of a comprehensive restructuring
program, we plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 900 positions. annual cost savings are expected to exceed $130 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of 2016. in
connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related primarily to workforce reductions. we expect to record
additional restructuring expense in 2015 once negotiations of employee termination benefits with european works councils are completed. 

on
february 12, 2015, we announced plans to reduce our titanium dioxide capacity by approximately 100 kt by closing specific operations at our calais, france facility, subject to
consultation with employees and appropriate representative groups. annual cost savings are expected to be approximately $35 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of 2016. this
plan is in addition to that announced on december 1, 2014. 

• during 2014, after extensive analysis, we filed amended u.s. tax returns for tax years 2008 thought 2012, along with our original u.s.
tax return for tax year 2013, which allowed us to utilize foreign tax credits. as a result of utilizing these assets, we realized reductions in our cash taxes paid of $55 million for 2014 and
expect to realize an additional $12 million reduction in future cash taxes paid. 
• on october 1, 2014, we completed the rockwood acquisition for a purchase price of $1.04 billion in cash, subject to
certain purchase price adjustments. see "note 3. acquisition and dispositions—rockwood acquisition" to our consolidated financial statements. the transaction was financed by a
$1.2 billion new term loan under our existing senior credit facilities. see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt" to our consolidated financial statements.  
• in august 2014, we completed an amendment to our senior credit facilities to increase our commitments by $200 million to our
existing revolving facility to an aggregate principal amount of $600 million. see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt" to our consolidated financial 

84




 


table of contents




statements.
in addition, in october 2014, we further increased commitments under our revolving facility by $25 million to an aggregate principal amount of $625 million. 



• during the first half of 2015, we will have scheduled maintenance at our po/mtbe facility in port neches, texas. we estimate the
facility will be off-line for approximately 60 days and the ebitda impact will be approximately $60 million. this amount includes lost revenue and unabsorbed fixed costs for the period.
in addition, the maintenance costs will be approximately $90 million; however, these costs will be capitalized and amortized over approximately five years until the next scheduled maintenance
outage reducing future ebitda over that period of time. 


as
of december 31, 2014, we had $267 million classified as current portion of debt, including debt at our variable interest entities of $172 million, a short term
borrowing facility in china totaling $36 million, our scheduled senior credit facilities amortization payments totaling $26 million, our annual financing of various insurance premiums
totaling $14 million, and certain other short-term facilities and scheduled amortization payments totaling $19 million. although we cannot provide assurances, we intend to renew or
extend the majority of these short-term facilities in the current period. 

as
of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $356 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries, including our variable
interest entities. additionally, we have material intercompany debt obligations owed to us by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we intend to use cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to fund our local
operations. nevertheless, we could repatriate cash as dividends or as repayments of intercompany debt. if foreign cash were repatriated as dividends, the dividends could be subject to u.s. federal and
state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief. at present, we estimate that we will generate sufficient cash in our u.s. operations, together with the payments of intercompany
debt, if necessary, to meet our cash needs in the u.s. and we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. as dividends. cash held by certain foreign subsidiaries, including our variable interest
entities, may also be subject to legal restrictions, including those arising from the interests of our partners, which could limit the amounts available for repatriation.

to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period, such notice period has been included in the above table. the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts
is variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations. we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited
number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased. we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended

restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs  

on december 1, 2014, we announced that we are taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our pigments
and additives segment. as part of a comprehensive restructuring program, we plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 900 positions. annual cost savings are expected to exceed $130 million
and are expected to be achieved by the middle of 2016. in connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 related
primarily to workforce reductions. we expect to record additional restructuring expense in 2015 once negotiations of employee termination benefits with european works councils are completed. 

on
february 12, 2015, we announced plans to reduce our titanium dioxide capacity by approximately 100 kt by closing specific operations at our calais, france facility,
subject to consultation with employees and appropriate representative groups. annual cost savings are expected to be approximately $35 million and are expected to be achieved by the middle of
2016. this plan is in addition to that announced on december 1, 2014. 


during
2013, our performance products segment initiated a restructuring program to refocus its surfactants business in europe. in connection with this program, in 2014 we completed the
sale of our european commodity surfactants business, including the ethoxylation facility in lavera, france to wilmar. in addition, wilmar has entered into a multi-year arrangement to purchase certain
sulfated surfactant products from our facilities in st. mihiel, france and castiglione delle stiviere, italy. additionally, in 2014 we ceased production at our patrica, italy surfactants
facility. during 2014, we recorded charges of $23 million primarily related to workforce reductions. we expect to complete this program by the end of 2015.

critical accounting policies  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. our significant accounting policies are summarized in "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" to our
consolidated financial statements. summarized below are our critical accounting policies: 







contingent loss accruals  

environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation, available technology, site-specific information and remediation alternatives. we accrue an
amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information. the extent of environmental impacts may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation
may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved. our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available, technology that
can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage. adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses. for
further information, see "note 19. environmental, health and safety matters" to our consolidated financial statements. 

we
are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business operations. we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of
probable losses. a determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known claim. we have an active risk management program
consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. these policies often provide coverage that is intended to minimize the financial impact, if any, of the legal proceedings. the
required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. for further information, see "note 18. commitments and contingencies—legal matters" to our
consolidated financial statements. 








employee benefit programs  

we sponsor several contributory and non-contributory defined benefit plans, covering employees primarily in the u.s., the u.k., the
netherlands, belgium and switzerland, but also covering employees in a number of other countries. we fund the material plans through trust arrangements (or local equivalents) where the assets are held
separately from us. we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the u.s., canada and south africa.
amounts recorded in our consolidated financial

statements
are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries. inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected long-term rates of return
on plan assets, discount rates, compensation increases, mortality rates and health care cost trends. these assumptions are described in "note 16. employee benefit plans" to our consolidated
financial statements. 

management,
with the advice of actuaries, uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based. the effect
of a 1% change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):

goodwill  

we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. more than 60% of
our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit. the remaining goodwill relates to three other reporting units. 


fair
value is estimated using the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. the estimated fair values of our reporting units are
dependent on several significant assumptions including, among others, market information, operating results, earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows. 

we
tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2014 as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
our most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amounts of reporting units by a significant margin. 








income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation
allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred
tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and
cumulative income or losses during the applicable 

88




 

table of contents

period.
cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable
jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. as of december 31, 2014, we had total valuation allowances of $702 million. see "note 17.
income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our valuation allowances. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that are reinvested
and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. we have material intercompany debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation, combined with the ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of intercompany debt owed by
our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividends, we will repay certain of our intercompany debt. if any
earnings were repatriated via dividend, we may need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. as discussed in "note 17. income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements, we made a
distribution of a portion of our earnings in 2013 when the amount of foreign tax credits associated with the distribution was greater than the amount of tax otherwise due. the undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries with positive earnings that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately $307 million at december 31, 2014. it is not practicable to determine the
unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings because of the significant assumptions necessary to compute the tax. 


accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to be
realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and
the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions in order to measure
the amount of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing
authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in
assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements. 







long-lived assets  

the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience, engineering estimates and
industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets. the estimated lives of our property range from 3 to
50 years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method. inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual
capital expenditures will be performed. without on-going capital improvements and maintenance, the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter. 

management
uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets. at december 31, 2014, if the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment had either
been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives, then depreciation expense for 2014 would have been approximately $34 million less or $40 million greater, respectively. 

we
are required to evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or
when 

89




 

table of contents

management's
plans change regarding those assets, such as idling or closing a plant. we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely
independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values. key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life, technology, competitive pressures, raw
material pricing and regulations. in connection with our asset evaluation policy, we reviewed all of our long-lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. we determined
that such indicators did not exist during the year ended december 31, 2014. 








restructuring and plant closing costs  

we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations, workforce reductions and
other cost savings programs in each of our business segments, other than performance products. these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to
the plan. estimates for plant closing costs include the write-off of the carrying value of the plant, any necessary environmental and/or regulatory costs, contract termination and demolition costs.
estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated, termination benefits to be provided and other information, as
necessary. management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the currently recorded estimate. for
further discussion of our restructuring activities, see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs" to our consolidated financial statements. 







revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we recognize revenue
when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, collectability is
reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 

revenue
arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, which relate primarily to the licensing of technology, are evaluated in accordance with asc 605-25,  revenue recognition—multiple-element arrangements, to determine whether the arrangements
should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting. 







variable interest entities—primary beneficiary  

we evaluate each of our variable interest entities on an on-going basis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. management
assesses, on an on-going basis, the nature of our relationship to the variable interest entity, including the amount of control that we exercise over the entity as well as the amount of risk that we
bear and rewards we receive in regards to the entity, to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. management judgment is required to assess whether these
attributes are significant. we consolidate all variable interest entities for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary.  


 
item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk        

we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks. from time to
time, we enter into transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations.
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

90






 



































 



table of contents 







interest rate risks  

through our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio,
including the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as well as
entering into interest rate derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate long-term debt. under
interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount. 

huntsman
international has entered into several interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our
senior credit
facilities. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income (dollars in
millions):

in
2009, sasol-huntsman, our consolidated 50% owned joint venture, entered into derivative transactions to hedge the variable interest rate associated with its local credit facility.
these derivative rate hedges include a floating to fixed interest rate contract providing sasol-huntsman with euribor interest payments for a fixed payment of 3.62% and a cap for future periods with a
strike price of 3.62%. as of december 31, 2014, the interest rate contracts expired and we have only the remaining interest cap for future periods until december 2018. in connection with the
consolidation of sasol-huntsman as of april 1, 2011, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable interest entities." the notional amount
of the interest rate caps as of december 31, 2014 was €22 million (approximately $27 million) and the derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of this hedge was nil and €1 million (approximately $1 million), respectively, and was recorded in other
noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. for 2014 and
2013, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of €1 million (approximately $1 million) and €1 million (approximately $2 million),
respectively, due to changes in the fair value of the swap. 

beginning
in 2009, arabian amines company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed payment of 5.02%.
in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable interest
entities." the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2014 was $28 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. as of december 31, 2014
and 2013, the fair value of the swap was $3 million and $4 million, respectively, and was recorded as other current liabilities on our consolidated 

91




 

table of contents

balance
sheets. for 2014 and 2013, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, due to changes in fair value of the swap. as of
december 31, 2014 arabian amines company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in its loan commitments. for more information, see "note 13.
debt—direct and subsidiary debt—variable interest entity debt." 


for
the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) associated with these cash flow hedging activities were approximately
$2 million and $(3) million, respectively. 

during
2015, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 







foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in
various currencies. we enter into foreign
currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help
reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally through the purchase of spot or forward
foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our
cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had approximately $179 million and $193 million notional amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding,
respectively, in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month. 

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed usd payments of $5 million semi annually on may 15 and november 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately €3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). as of december 31, 2014 the fair value of this swap was $5 million and
recorded in noncurrent assets. 

in
conjunction with the issuance of our 2020 senior subordinated notes, we entered into cross-currency interest rate contracts with three counterparties. on march 17, 2010, we
made payments of $350 million to these counterparties and received €255 million from these counterparties, and on maturity (march 15, 2015) we are required to pay
€255 million to these counterparties and will receive $350 million from these counterparties. on march 15 and september 15 of each year, we will receive
u.s. dollar interest payments of approximately $15 million (equivalent to an annual rate of 8.625%) and make interest payments of approximately €11 million (equivalent to
an annual rate of approximately 8.41%). this swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of this swap was
$43 million and $2 million, respectively, and was recorded in current assets. on february 11, 2015, we terminated $200 million notional amounts of these cross-currency
interest rate contracts and received a $37 million payment from the counterparty.

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2014, we have designated
approximately €655 million (approximately $800 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. for the
years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the amount of gain (loss) recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $97 million, $(22) million and $(11) million, respectively, and
was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately €1,516 million (approximately $1,851 million) in net euro assets. 







commodity prices risk  

our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market
related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we
do not generally hedge our commodity exposures.  

 
item 8.    financial statements and supplementary data        

our consolidated financial statements required by this item are included on the pages immediately following the index to consolidated
financial statements appearing on page f-1.  

 
item 9.    changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure        

there have been no changes in our independent accountants, deloitte & touche llp, or disagreements with them on matters
of accounting or financial disclosure.  

 
item 9a.    controls and procedures        







evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act) as of december 31, 2014. based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of december 31, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and
(2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

changes in internal control over financial reporting  

no changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2014 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act). 








management's report on internal control over financial reporting  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control
framework and processes for our company and huntsman international are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management, huntsman international's board of managers and our board of directors
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of
america. 

our
internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international includes those policies and procedures that:



• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of our company and huntsman international; 
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded properly to allow for the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company and huntsman international are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of our company and huntsman international; 
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; and 
• provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud. 


because
of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. further,
because of changing conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 

on
october 1, 2014, we completed the rockwood acquisition. as a result, we have excluded the internal controls of rockwood from our annual evaluation of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international. for the year ended december 31, 2014, rockwood represents 2.9% of total revenues of our company and
huntsman international, and as of december 31, 2014, rockwood represents 13.4% and 13.3% of total assets of our company and huntsman international, respectively. 

our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international and concluded that, as of december 31, 2014,
such internal control is effective. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in  internal control—integrated
framework (2013) ("coso"). 

our
independent registered public accountants, deloitte & touche llp, with direct access to our board of directors through our audit committee, have audited our
consolidated financial statements prepared by our company and huntsman international and have issued attestation reports on internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman
international.

management's process to assess the effectiveness of  internal control over financial reporting


to
comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we completed a comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our
internal control over financial reporting for our company and huntsman international. we involved employees at all levels of our company during 2014 in training, performing and evaluating our internal
controls. 

our
management's conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the five elements of coso. our
management considered information from multiple sources as the basis its conclusion—including self-assessments of the control activities within each work process, assessments of
division-level and entity-level controls and internal control attestations from key external service providers, as well as from key management. in addition, our internal control processes contain
self-monitoring mechanisms, and proactive steps are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. we also maintain an internal auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting within each of the five coso elements.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in  internal control—integrated
framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. as described in
management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial
reporting at performance additives and titanium dioxide businesses of rockwood holdings, inc. ("rockwood"), which was acquired on october 1, 2014 and whose financial statements
constitute 13.4% of total assets and 2.9% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014. accordingly, our audit did not include the
internal control over financial reporting at rockwood. the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

we
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in  internal control—integrated
framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.

prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

in
our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in  internal control—integrated
framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of directors and stockholders of
huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014. our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. 


we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31,
2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 18, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm        

to
the board of managers and members of
huntsman international llc and subsidiaries 

we
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014. our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the index on page f-1. these financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the company's management. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 


we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

in
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of huntsman international llc and subsidiaries as of
december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 

we
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 18, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting.

otherwise requires, its subsidiaries and predecessors. any references to our "company" "we" "us" or "our" as of a date prior to october 19, 2004 (the date of our company's formation) are to
huntsman holdings, llc and its
subsidiaries (including their respective predecessors). in this report, "huntsman international" refers to huntsman international llc (our 100% owned subsidiary) and, unless the context
otherwise requires, its subsidiaries; "hps" refers to huntsman polyurethanes shanghai ltd. (our consolidated splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor-alkali chemical company, ltd);
and "slic" refers to shanghai liengheng isocyanate company (our unconsolidated manufacturing joint venture with basf and three chinese chemical companies). 


in
this report, we may use, without definition, the common names of competitors or other industry participants. we may also use the common names or abbreviations for certain chemicals or
products. 







description of business  

we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products. our products comprise a
broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those
in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, medical, packaging, paints and coatings, power
generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including mdi, amines, surfactants, maleic anhydride,
epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. 

we
operate in five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. our polyurethanes, performance products, advanced
materials and textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments and additives segment produces inorganic chemical products. in a series of transactions
beginning in 2006, we sold or shutdown substantially all of our australian styrenics operations and our north american polymers and base chemicals operations. we report the results of these businesses
as discontinued operations. 







company  

our company, a delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the huntsman businesses. jon m. huntsman founded the predecessor to our
company in 1970 as a small packaging company. since then, we have grown through a series of acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses. 


currently,
we operate all of our businesses through huntsman international, our 100% owned subsidiary. huntsman international is a delaware limited liability company and was formed in
1999.

1. general (continued) 







huntsman corporation and huntsman international financial statements  

except where otherwise indicated, these notes relate to the consolidated financial statements for both our company and huntsman
international. the differences between our consolidated financial statements and huntsman international's consolidated financial statements relate primarily to the
following:



• purchase accounting recorded at our company for the 2003 step-acquisition of huntsman international holdings llc, the former
parent company of huntsman international that was merged into huntsman international in 2005; 
• the different capital structures; and 
• a note payable from huntsman international to us. 








2. summary of significant accounting policies  







asset retirement obligations  

we accrue for asset retirement obligations, which consist primarily of landfill capping, closure and post-closure costs and asbestos
abatement costs, in the period in which the obligations are incurred. asset retirement obligations are accrued at estimated fair value. when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost
by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. over time, the liability is accreted to its estimated settlement value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life
of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded. asset retirement obligations were
$26 million and $29 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 







carrying value of long-lived assets  

we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability is based upon current and anticipated undiscounted cash flows, and we recognize an impairment when such estimated cash
flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is based upon the difference between carrying value and fair value. fair value is generally
estimated by discounting estimated future cash
flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. see "note 11. restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs." 







cash and cash equivalents  

we consider cash in checking accounts and cash in short-term highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or
less at the date of purchase, to be cash and cash equivalents. cash flows from discontinued operations are not presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 







cost of goods sold  

we classify the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products as cost of goods sold. manufacturing costs include variable costs,
primarily raw materials and energy, and fixed expenses directly associated with production. manufacturing costs also include, among other things, plant site operating costs and overhead (including
depreciation), production planning and logistics costs, repair and maintenance costs, plant site purchasing costs, and engineering and technical support costs. distribution, freight and warehousing
costs are also included in cost of goods sold. 







derivatives and hedging activities  

all derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. if the derivative
is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in
the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income
statement when the hedged item affects earnings. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain international operations are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), to
the extent effective. the effectiveness of a cash flow hedging relationship is established at the inception of the hedge, and after inception we perform effectiveness assessments at least every three
months. a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is determined to be effective if the change in value of the hedge divided by the change in value of the hedged item is within a range of 80% to
125%. hedge ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedge occurs only if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the
hedged transaction. for a derivative that does not qualify or has not been designated as a hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. 







environmental expenditures  

environmental related restoration and remediation costs are recorded as liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation
and clean-up obligations are either known or considered probable and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. other environmental expenditures that are principally maintenance or preventative in
nature are recorded when expended and incurred and are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. see "note 19. environmental, health and safety matters." 







foreign currency translation  

the accounts of our operating subsidiaries outside of the u.s., unless they are operating in highly inflationary economic environments,
consider the functional currency to be the currency of the economic environment in which they operate. accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated at a weighted average rate for the period. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded to equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss. 

if
a subsidiary operates in an economic environment that is considered to be highly inflationary (100% cumulative inflation over a three-year period), the u.s. dollar is considered to be
the functional

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

currency
and gains and losses from remeasurement to the u.s. dollar from the local currency are included in the statement of operations. where a subsidiary's operations are effectively run, managed,
financed and contracted in u.s. dollars, such as certain finance subsidiaries outside of the u.s., the u.s. dollar is considered to be the functional currency. 

foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other operating (income) expense in our consolidated statements of operations and were net losses of $15 million,
$11 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 







income taxes  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they
will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed on a tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the
realizability of the related deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction. these conclusions require significant judgment. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we
consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence
such as our projections for the future. changes in expected future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. 


we
do not provide for income taxes or benefits on the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be
reinvested indefinitely. 

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. the application of income tax law is inherently complex. we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more-likely-than-not to be
realized based on the merits of the position under tax law, in order to recognize an income tax benefit. this requires us to make significant judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and
the application of income tax law. additionally, if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more-likely-than-not we are required to make judgments and apply assumptions to measure the amount
of the tax benefits to recognize. these judgments are based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be
realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities. interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. as a consequence, changes in
assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

intangible assets and goodwill  


intangible assets are stated at cost (fair value at the time of acquisition) and are amortized using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives or the life of the related agreement as follows: 
 













patents and technology
 
5 - 30 years


trademarks
 
13 - 30 years


licenses and other agreements
 
5 - 15 years


other intangibles
 
5 - 15 years



 
goodwill
represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not subject to any method of amortization, but is tested for
impairment annually (at the beginning of the third quarter) and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related reporting unit, we are required to reduce the amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings. fair value is estimated using
the market approach, as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections. goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. the net change to
goodwill in response to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2014 was $9 million. 







inventories  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using lifo, first-in first-out, and average costs methods
for different components of inventory. 








legal costs  

we expense legal costs, including those legal costs incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. 







net income per share attributable to huntsman corporation  

basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to huntsman corporation common
stockholders by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the period. diluted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing net income available to
huntsman corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as
dilutive securities.

additional
stock-based awards of 1.0 million, 7.3 million and 7.8 million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the years ended
december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. however, these stock-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the respective periods mentioned because
the effect would be anti-dilutive. 







other noncurrent assets  

other noncurrent assets consist primarily of spare parts, deferred debt issuance costs, the overfunded portion related to defined
benefit plans for employees and capitalized turnaround costs. debt issuance costs are amortized using the interest method over the term of the related debt. 







principles of consolidation  

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and any variable
interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 







property, plant and equipment  

property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives or lease term as follows: 
 













buildings and equipment
 
5 - 50 years


plant and equipment
 
3 - 30 years


furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements
 
5 - 20 years



 
interest
expense capitalized as part of plant and equipment was $16 million, $7 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.

2. summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 

periodic
maintenance and repairs applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities (a "turnaround") are accounted for on the deferral basis by capitalizing the costs of the
turnaround and amortizing the costs over the estimated period until the next turnaround. normal maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred. renewals, betterments
and major repairs that materially extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized, and the assets replaced, if any, are retired. 








revenue recognition  

we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long-term supply agreements. we recognize revenue
when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists, risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, collectability is
reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made. 

revenue
arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, which relate primarily to licensing of technology, are evaluated to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into
separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting. 







securitization of accounts receivable  

under our a/r programs, we grant an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables to the u.s. spe and the eu spe. this
undivided interest serves as security for the issuance of debt. the a/r programs provide for financing in both u.s. dollars and euros. the amounts outstanding under our a/r programs are
accounted for as secured borrowings. see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—a/r programs." 







stock-based compensation  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of

subsequent events  

we have evaluated material subsequent events through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. 







use of estimates  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates.

recently issued accounting pronouncements  







accounting pronouncements adopted during 2014  

in february 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2013-04,  liabilities (topic 405):
obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting
date, requiring entities to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting
date, as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its
co-obligors. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013. the amendments in this asu should be applied
retrospectively to all prior periods presented for those obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of an entity's fiscal year of adoption. we
adopted the amendments in this asu effective january 1, 2014, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


in
march 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-05, foreign currency matters (topic 830): parent's accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon
derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity, resolving diversity in practice and clarifying the
applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a
controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or business within a foreign entity. we adopted the amendments in this asu effective january 1,
2014, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 


in
july 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-11, income taxes (topic 740): presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, providing guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements as either
a reduction to a deferred tax asset or as a liability to better reflect the manner in which an entity would settle at the reporting date any additional income taxes that would result from the
disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards ("nols"), similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist. the amendments in this asu do not require new recurring
disclosures. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013. we adopted the amendments in this asu
effective january 1, 2014, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
november 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-17, business combinations (topic 805): pushdown accounting, providing guidance on
whether and at what threshold an acquired entity that is a business or nonprofit activity can apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements. the amendments in this asu provide an
acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. an acquired
entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting

period
in which the change-in-control event occurs or otherwise in a subsequent reporting period to the acquired entity's most recent change-in-control event. the amendments in this asu were effective
on november 18, 2014. after the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event.
we adopted the amendments in this asu effective november 18, 2014, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this asu did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 







accounting pronouncements pending adoption in future periods  

in april 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and
property, plant, and equipment (topic 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, changing the criteria for reporting
discontinued operations and enhancing reporting requirements for discontinued operations. a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity will be required to be reported
in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. further, the amendments in this asu will
require an entity to present, for each comparative period, the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in the asset and liability sections,
respectively, of the
statement of financial position. the amendments in this asu are effective prospectively for all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) of components of an entity that occur within annual
periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, and for all businesses that, on acquisition, are classified as held for sale that occur within annual
periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements. 

in
may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), outlining a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. the amendments in this asu are
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively,
and early application is not permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the amendments in this asu on our consolidated financial statements. 

in
august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statements—going concern (subtopic 205-40): disclosure of
uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, providing guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt
about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. the amendments in this asu are effective for the annual period ending after december 15,
2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this asu to have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

in
january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-01, income statement—extraordinary and unusual items (subtopic 225-20): simplifying income
statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items, eliminating from us gaap the concept of extraordinary items. reporting entities will no longer
have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is extraordinary. the

rockwood acquisition  

on october 1, 2014, we completed the rockwood acquisition. we paid $1.04 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase
price adjustments, and assumed certain unfunded pension liabilities in connection with the rockwood acquisition. the acquisition was financed using a bank term loan. the majority of the acquired
businesses have been integrated into our pigments and additives segment. transaction costs charged to expense related to this acquisition were $24 million and $8 million for the years
ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 

the
following businesses were acquired from rockwood:



• titanium dioxide, a white pigment derived from titanium bearing ores with strong specialty business in fibers, inks, pharmaceuticals,
food and cosmetics; 
• functional additives made from barium and zinc based inorganics used to make colors more brilliant, primarily in plastics, coatings,
films, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and paper; 
• color pigments made from synthetic iron-oxide and other non-tio2 inorganic pigments used by manufacturers of coatings and colorants;  
• timber treatment wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications;  
• water treatment products used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications; and  
• specialty automotive molded components. 


in
connection with securing certain regulatory approvals required to complete the rockwood acquisition, we sold our tio2 tr52 product line used in printing inks to henan in december
2014. the sale did not include any manufacturing assets but does include an agreement to supply tr52 product to henan during a transitional period. 

we
have accounted for the rockwood acquisition using the acquisition method. as such, we analyzed the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the

equipment, intangible assets, asset retirement obligations, and environmental and other legal reserves, and finalizing the expected purchase price adjustment receivable. none of the fair value of this
acquisition was allocated to goodwill. it is possible that changes to this allocation could occur. the acquired businesses had revenues and net loss of $330 million and $2 million,
respectively, for the period from the date of acquisition to december 31, 2014. if the rockwood acquisition were to have occurred on january 1, 2013, the following estimated pro forma

oxid acquisition  

on august 29, 2013, we completed the oxid acquisition. the acquisition cost of approximately $76 million consists of cash
payments of approximately $66 million and contingent consideration of $10 million. the contingent consideration relates to an earn-out agreement which will be paid over two years if
certain conditions are met. related to this earn-out agreement, $6 million was paid during 2014 and the balance has been paid in 2015. the acquired business has been integrated into our
polyurethanes segment. transaction costs charged to expense related to this acquisition were not significant.

textile effects acquisition  

on june 30, 2006, we acquired ciba's textile effects business and accounted for the textile effects acquisition using the
purchase method. as such, we analyzed the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and determined the excess of fair value of net assets over cost. because the
fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed exceeded the purchase price, the value of the long-lived assets acquired was reduced to zero. accordingly, no basis was assigned to property,
plant and equipment or any other non-current nonfinancial assets and the remaining excess was recorded as an extraordinary gain. during 2012, we recorded an additional extraordinary gain on the
acquisition of $2 million, related to settlement of contingent purchase price consideration, the reversal of accruals for certain restructuring and employee termination costs recorded in
connection with the textile effects acquisition and a reimbursement by ciba of certain costs pursuant to the acquisition agreements.

thus giving us an indirect 35% interest in slic.  
 
on
november 13, 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with sinopec (nanjing jingling). the joint venture involves the construction and operation of a
po/mtbe facility in china. under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and sinopec holds a 51% interest. our total equity investment is anticipated to be
approximately $90 million, net of reimbursements, and we expect to receive approximately $50 million of license fees from the joint venture. the timing of equity contributions and
license fee payments depends on various factors, but the majority are expected to be made over the course of the construction period of the plant (expected to be completed in the second half of 2016).
at the end of 2014, cumulative capital contributions were approximately $85 million, net of license fees from the joint venture. 







7. variable interest entities  


we evaluate our investments and transactions to identify variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. we hold a variable interest in the following joint ventures
for which we are the primary beneficiary:



• rubicon llc manufactures products for our polyurethanes and performance products segments. the structure of the joint venture
is such that the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its activities without additional financial support. by virtue of the operating agreement with
this joint venture, we purchase a majority of the output, absorb a majority of the operating costs and provide a majority of the additional funding.

• pacific iron products sdn bhd manufactures products for our pigments and additives segment. in this joint venture we supply all the
raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers. through a fixed price raw materials supply contract
with the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. 
• arabian amines company manufactures products for our performance products segment. as required in the operating agreement governing
this joint venture, we purchase all of arabian amines company's production and sell it to our customers. substantially all of the joint venture's activities are conducted on our behalf.  
• sasol-huntsman is our 50%-owned joint venture with sasol that owns and operates a maleic anhydride facility in moers, germany. this
joint venture manufactures products for our performance products segment. the joint venture uses our technology and expertise, and we bear a disproportionate amount of risk of loss due to a
related-party loan to sasol-huntsman for which we bear the default risk. 
• viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with dow chemical. viance markets timber treatment products for our pigments and additives
segment. our joint venture interest in viance was acquired as part of the rockwood acquisition on october 1, 2014. the joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing
arrangement at our harrisburg, north carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on viance's

2014 restructuring activities  

in connection with a september 2014 announcement of a feasibility study into a mdi production expansion at our geismar, louisiana
facility, we concluded that certain capitalized engineering costs associated with a previously planned mdi production expansion at our rotterdam, the netherlands facility were impaired and our
polyurethanes segment recorded a noncash impairment charge of $16 million during 2014. 

during
2013, our performance products segment initiated a restructuring program to refocus its surfactants business in europe. in connection with this program, in 2014 we completed the
sale of our european commodity surfactants business, including the ethoxylation facility in lavera, france to wilmar. in addition, wilmar has entered into a multi-year arrangement to purchase certain
sulfated surfactant products from our facilities in st. mihiel, france and castiglione delle stiviere, italy. additionally, in 2014 we ceased production at our patrica, italy surfactants
facility. during 2014, we recorded charges of $23 million primarily related to workforce reductions. we expect to complete this program by the end of 2015. 

during
2014, our advanced materials segment recorded charges of $11 million primarily related to workforce reductions with our global transformational change program designed to
improve the segment's manufacturing efficiencies, enhance its commercial excellence and improve its long-term global competitiveness. we expect to incur charges related to this program through the
second quarter of 2015.

direct and subsidiary debt  

huntsman corporation's direct debt and guarantee obligations consist of a guarantee of certain indebtedness incurred from time to time
to finance certain insurance premiums. substantially all of our other debt, including the facilities described below, has been incurred by our subsidiaries (primarily huntsman international); huntsman
corporation is not a guarantor of such subsidiary debt. 

certain
of our subsidiaries are designated as nonguarantor subsidiaries and have third-party debt agreements. these debt agreements contain certain restrictions with regard to dividends,
distributions, loans or advances. in certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to us.

(1)we
had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving facility; we had approximately $16 million (u.s. dollar equivalents) of letters of credit and
bank guarantees issued and outstanding under our revolving facility.
(2)the
2014 new term loan is subject to a 0.75% libor floor.
(3)the
applicable interest rate of the senior credit facilities is subject to certain secured leverage ratio thresholds. as of december 31, 2014, the
weighted average interest rate on our outstanding balances under the senior credit facilities was approximately 3%.  
 
our
obligations under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by our guarantors, and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic property, plant and
equipment, the stock of all of our material domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries, and pledges of intercompany notes between certain of our subsidiaries. 







amendment to the credit agreement  

on october 15, 2013, huntsman international entered into a tenth amendment to the agreement governing the credit agreement. the
amendment, among other things, permitted us to incur a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion, the 2014 new term loan, and to increase our revolving
facility. in august 2014, we entered into the eleventh and twelfth amendments, which modified the credit agreement to initially fund the 2014 new term loan into escrow and completed the increase of

in full $350 million of its 2020 senior subordinated notes, pay associated accrued interest and for general corporate purposes. 


the
2022 senior notes bear interest at 5.125% per year, payable semi-annually on november 15 and may 15, and are due on november 15, 2022. huntsman international may
redeem the 2022 senior notes in whole or in part at any time prior to august 15, 2022 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid
interest. 

on
june 2, 2014, pursuant to an indenture entered into on december 23, 2013, huntsman international issued €145 million (approximately
$197 million) aggregate principal amount of additional 2021 senior notes. the additional notes are recorded at carrying value €149 million (approximately
$182 million) as of december 31, 2014. 

the
2021 senior notes bear interest at 5.125% per year, payable semi-annually on april 15 and october 15, and are due on april 15, 2021. huntsman international may
redeem the 2021 senior notes in whole or in part at any time prior to january 15, 2021 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and
unpaid interest. 

the
2020, 2021 and 2022 senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of huntsman international and are guaranteed on a general unsecured senior basis by the guarantors. the
indentures impose certain limitations on the ability of huntsman international and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness secured by any principal properties, incur
indebtedness of nonguarantor subsidiaries, enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to any principal properties and consolidate or merge with or into any other person or lease, sell or
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets. upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, holders of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 senior notes will have the right to require
that huntsman international purchase all or a portion of such holder's notes in cash at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
repurchase.

13. debt (continued) 







variable interest entity debt  

as of december 31, 2014, arabian amines company had $158 million outstanding under its loan commitments and debt
financing arrangements. arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, is currently not in compliance with payment and other obligations under these loan commitments. we do not
guarantee these loan commitments and arabian amines company is not a guarantor of any of our other debt obligations, and the noncompliance with these financial covenants does not affect any of our
other debt obligations. we are currently in
discussions with the lenders under these loan commitments and expect to resolve the noncompliance. as of december 31, 2014, the amounts outstanding under these loan commitments were classified
as current on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

as
of december 31, 2014, sasol-huntsman, our consolidated 50%-owned venture has €40 million (approximately $49 million) outstanding under the term
loan facility. the facility will be repaid over semiannual installments with the final repayment scheduled for december 2018. obligations under the facility agreement are secured by, among other
things, first priority right on the property, plant and equipment of sasol-huntsman. 







note payable from huntsman international to huntsman corporation  

as of december 31, 2014, we have a loan of $750 million to our subsidiary, huntsman international. the intercompany note
is unsecured and $100 million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of december 31, 2014 on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2014, under the
terms of the intercompany note, huntsman international promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly average borrowing rate obtained
under our u.s. a/r program, less 10 basis points (provided that the rate shall not exceed an amount that is 25 basis points less than the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the u.s.
libor-based borrowings under our revolving facility). 







compliance with covenants  

we believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including
our senior credit facilities, our a/r programs and our notes. however, arabian amines company, our consolidated 50%-owned joint venture, is currently not in compliance with certain financial covenants
contained under its loan commitments. see "—variable interest entity debt" above. 

our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. a failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). a default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable. furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a
failure to comply with the
covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement.

13. debt (continued) 

our
senior credit facilities are the leverage covenant which applies only to the revolving facility and is calculated at the huntsman international level. the leverage covenant is
applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding). the
leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international's ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda (as defined in the applicable agreement) is not
more than 3.75 to 1. 

if
in the future huntsman international fails to comply with the leverage covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility. if huntsman international
failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility, huntsman international would be in default under
the senior credit facilities, and, unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), huntsman international could
be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities. 

the
agreements governing our a/r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. any material failure to meet the applicable a/r programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the a/r programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the a/r programs in full. an early termination event under the a/r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit
facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities.

14. derivative instruments and hedging activities  


we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks. from time to time, we enter into transactions, including
transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations. changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net
investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 








interest rate risks  

through our borrowing activities, we are exposed to interest rate risk. such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio,
including the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities, as well as
entering into interest rate derivative instruments. 

from
time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate long-term debt. under
interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount. 

huntsman
international has entered into several interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our
senior credit facilities. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income

in
2009, sasol-huntsman, our consolidated 50% owned joint venture, entered into derivative transactions to hedge the variable interest rate associated with its local credit facility.
these derivative rate hedges include a floating to fixed interest rate contract providing sasol-huntsman with euribor interest payments for a fixed payment of 3.62% and a cap for future periods with a
strike price of 3.62%. as of december 31, 2014, the interest rate contracts expired and we have only the remaining interest cap for future periods until december 2018. in connection with the
consolidation of sasol-huntsman as of april 1, 2011, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable interest entities." the notional amount
of the interest rate caps as of december 31,

2014
was €22 million (approximately $27 million) and the derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair
value of this hedge was nil and €1 million (approximately $1 million), respectively, and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. for 2014 and 2013, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of €1 million (approximately $1 million) and €1 million
(approximately $2 million), respectively, due to changes in the fair value of the swap. 

beginning
in 2009, arabian amines company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of libor interest payments for a fixed payment of 5.02%.
in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. see "note 7. variable interest
entities." the notional amount of the swap as of december 31, 2014 was $28 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. as of december 31, 2014
and 2013, the fair value of the swap was $3 million and $4 million, respectively, and was recorded as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. for 2014 and 2013, we
recorded a reduction of interest expense of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, due to changes in fair value of the swap. as of december 31, 2014 arabian amines company was
not in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in its loan commitments. for more information, see "note 13. debt—direct and subsidiary debt—variable
interest entity debt." 

for
the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) associated with these cash flow hedging activities were approximately
$2 million and $(3) million, respectively. 

during
2015, accumulated other comprehensive loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings. the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months
may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions. we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments. we
anticipate, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. market risk arises from changes in interest rates. 







foreign exchange rate risk  

our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. our revenues and expenses are denominated in
various currencies. we enter into foreign
currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help
reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally through the purchase of spot or forward
foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of three months or less). we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our
cash flows and earnings. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had approximately $179 million and $193 million notional amount (in u.s. dollar equivalents) outstanding,
respectively, in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month.

14. derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued) 

in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional €161 million. the swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed usd payments of $5 million semi annually on may 15 and november 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately €3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). as of december 31, 2014 the fair value of this swap was $5 million and
recorded in noncurrent assets. 

in
conjunction with the issuance of our 2020 senior subordinated notes, we entered into cross-currency interest rate contracts with three counterparties. on march 17, 2010, we
made payments of $350 million to these counterparties and received €255 million from these counterparties, and on maturity (march 15, 2015) we are required to pay
€255 million to these counterparties and will receive $350 million from these counterparties. on march 15 and september 15 of each year, we will receive
u.s. dollar interest payments of approximately $15 million (equivalent to an annual rate of 8.625%) and make interest payments of approximately €11 million (equivalent to
an annual rate of approximately 8.41%). this swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of this swap was
$43 million and $2 million, respectively, and was recorded in current assets. on february 11, 2015, we terminated $200 million notional amounts of these cross-currency
interest rate contracts and received a $37 million payment from the counterparty. 

a
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. we also finance certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges. 


foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. from time to time, we review such designation of intercompany loans. 

we
review our non-u.s. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. as of december 31, 2014, we have designated
approximately €655 million (approximately $800 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. for the
years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the amount of gain (loss) recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $97 million, $(22) million and $(11) million, respectively, and
was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately €1,516 million (approximately $1,851 million) in net euro assets.

commodity prices risk  

our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market
related prices, and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice. consequently, we
do not generally hedge our commodity exposures.

maturity of these financial instruments. the fair value of non-qualified employee benefit plan investments is obtained through market observable pricing using prevailing market prices. the estimated
fair values of our long-term debt are based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market (level 1). 


the
fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. although management is not aware of any
factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since december 31, 2014,
and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

(1)the
income approach is used to calculate the fair value of these instruments. fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows,
calculated using relevant interest rates, exchange rates, and yield curves at stated intervals. there were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine the fair value
during the current period.
in
november 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract.
these instruments have been categorized by us as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs associated with the credit valuation adjustment, which we deemed to be
significant inputs to the overall measurement of fair value at inception.

the

significant unobservable inputs (level 3) (dollars in millions). during the year ended december 31, 2013, there were no instruments categorized as level 3 within the fair value
hierarchy.

we
also have assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets include property, plant and equipment and those
associated with acquired businesses, including goodwill and intangible assets. for these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if one or
more is determined to be impaired. during 2014 and 2013, we recorded charges of $26 million and nil, respectively, for the impairment of long-lived assets.

16. employee benefit plans  







defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans  

our employees participate in a trusteed, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the "plan") that covers substantially all of
our full-time u.s. employees. effective july 1, 2004, the plan formula for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement was converted to a cash balance design. for represented
employees, participation in the cash balance design is subject to the terms of negotiated contracts. for participating employees, benefits accrued under the prior formula were converted to opening
cash balance accounts. the new cash balance benefit formula provides annual pay credits from 4% to 12% of eligible pay, depending on age and service, plus accrued interest. participants in the plan on
july 1, 2004 may be eligible for additional annual pay credits from 1% to 8%, depending on their age and service as of that date, for up to five years. the conversion to the cash balance plan
did not have a significant impact on the accrued benefit liability, the funded status or ongoing pension expense. 

during
2013, we amended the plan which enabled us to transfer some benefit amounts out of the huntsman supplemental executive retirement plan (the "serp") to the plan as permitted by the
irs rules. there was no impact to the overall projected benefit obligation to the company as a result of this amendment. 

we
sponsor defined benefit plans in a number of countries outside of the u.s. the availability of these plans, and their specific design provisions, are consistent with local competitive
practices and regulations. 

we
also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, which provide medical and life insurance benefits. 


our
postretirement benefit plans provide a fully insured medicare part d plan including prescription drug benefits affected by the medicare prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (the "act"). we cannot determine whether the medical benefits provided by our postretirement benefit plans are actuarially equivalent to those provided by the act. we do not
collect a subsidy and our net periodic postretirement benefits cost, and related benefit obligation, do not reflect an amount associated with the subsidy. 

during
2013, we amended certain of our postretirement benefit plans to discontinue subsidizing the cost of health care coverage for retirees who are eligible for medicare. as a result of
this amendment, our projected benefit obligation decreased by $22 million with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended december 31, 2013. 

on
march 23, 2010, president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act. on march 30, 2010, president obama signed into law a reconciliation
measure, the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010. the passage of this legislation has resulted in comprehensive reform of health care in the u.s. we do not believe that this will have
a significant impact on our financial position. 


beginning
july 1, 2014, the huntsman defined benefit pension plan was closed to new non-union entrants. new, non-union entrants will be provided with a defined contribution plan
with a non-discretionary employer contribution and a company match. 

in
connection with the rockwood acquisition, we assumed certain pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the amount of approximately $233 million.

our
investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to pursue an investment plan that, over the long term, is expected to protect the funded status of the plan, enhance the real
purchasing power of plan assets, and not threaten the plan's ability to meet currently committed obligations. additionally, our investment strategy is to achieve returns on plan assets, subject to a
prudent level of portfolio risk. plan assets are invested in a broad range of investments. these investments are diversified in terms of domestic and international equities, both growth and value
funds, including small, mid and large capitalization equities; short-term and long-term debt securities; real estate; and cash and cash equivalents. the investments are further diversified within each
asset category. the portfolio diversification provides protection against a single investment or asset category having a disproportionate impact on the aggregate performance of the plan assets. 

our
pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers. the investment managers value our plan assets using quoted market prices, other observable inputs or unobservable
inputs. for certain assets, the investment managers obtain third-party appraisals at least annually, which use valuation techniques and inputs specific to the applicable property, market, or
geographic location. during 2014, there were no transfers in or out of level 3 assets.

16. employee benefit plans (continued)  







defined contribution
plans—u.s.  

we have a money purchase pension plan covering substantially all of our domestic employees who were hired prior to january 1,
2004. employer contributions are made based on a percentage of employees' earnings (ranging up to 8%). during 2014, we closed this plan to non-union participants, continuing to provide equivalent
benefits to those covered under this plan into their salary deferral account. 


we
also have a salary deferral plan covering substantially all u.s. employees. plan participants may elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their
compensation. we contribute an amount equal to one-half of the participant's contribution, not to exceed 2% of the participant's compensation. 

along
with the introduction of the cash balance formula within our defined benefit pension plan, the money purchase pension plan was closed to new hires. at the same time, our match in
the salary deferral plan was increased, for new hires, to a 100% match, not to exceed 4% of the participant's compensation, once the participant has achieved six years of service with our company. 


our
total combined expense for the above defined contribution plans for each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $15 million, $14 million and
$14 million, respectively. 







defined contribution
plans—non-u.s.  

we have defined contribution plans in a variety of non-u.s. locations. 


our
total combined expense for these defined contribution plans for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $14 million each, primarily related to the huntsman
uk pension plan. 

all
uk associates are eligible to participate in the huntsman uk pension plan, a contract-based arrangement with a third party. company contributions vary by business during a five year
transition period. plan participants elect to make voluntary contributions to this plan up to a specified amount of their compensation. we contribute a matching amount not to exceed 12% of the
participant's salary for new hires and 15% of the participant's salary for all other participants. 







supplemental salary deferral plan and supplemental executive
retirement plan  

the huntsman supplemental savings plan ("huntsman ssp") is a non-qualified plan covering key management employees and allows
participants to defer amounts that would otherwise be paid as compensation. the participant can defer up to 75% of their salary and bonus each year. this plan also provides benefits that would be
provided under the huntsman salary deferral plan if that plan were not subject to legal limits on the amount of contributions that can be allocated to an individual in a single year. the huntsman ssp
was amended and restated effective as of january 1, 2005 to allow eligible executive employees to comply with section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986. 

the
serp is an unfunded non-qualified pension plan established to provide certain executive employees with benefits that could not be provided, due to legal limitations, under the
huntsman

defined
benefit pension plan, a qualified defined benefit pension plan, and the huntsman money purchase pension plan, a qualified money purchase pension plan. 


assets
of these plans are included in other noncurrent assets and as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $24 million and $21 million, respectively. during each of the
years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we expensed a total of $1 million as contributions to the huntsman ssp and the serp. 







stock-based incentive plan  

in connection with the initial public offering of common and preferred stock on february 16, 2005, we adopted the huntsman stock
incentive plan (the "stock incentive plan"). the stock incentive plan permits the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, nonvested stock, phantom
stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock options may be
granted solely to employees. as of december 31, 2014 we are authorized to grant up to 37.2 million shares under the stock incentive plan. see "note 21. stock-based compensation
plan." 








international plans  

international employees are covered by various post-employment arrangements consistent with local practices and regulations. such
obligations are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

during
2012, we amended certain prior year u.s. federal income tax filings and claimed $31 million of additional u.s. foreign tax credits. due to uncertainty regarding our ability
to utilize these credits before they were to expire in 2015, we established a partial valuation allowance of $21 million against the incremental deferred tax asset. 

during
2013, we repatriated a significant amount of foreign earnings to the u.s., which included bringing onshore certain u.s. foreign tax credits. the foreign tax credits brought
onshore significantly exceeded the amount needed to offset the cash tax impact of the dividend. a full valuation allowance was placed on the remaining foreign tax credits since it was more likely than
not that the credits would expire unused due to a shortage of foreign source income for income tax purposes. in early 2014, the amount of foreign tax credits brought onshore was adjusted downward by
$10 million, to $104 million, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance. 

after
extensive research and analysis, in september 2014, we made certain elections and filed amended u.s. tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2012, along with our original u.s. tax
return for tax year 2013. these new tax elections and amended tax returns allowed us to utilize u.s. foreign tax credits.
the net result was $104 million of income tax benefit recognized during 2014 for the release of the associated valuation allowance, including a discrete income tax benefit of $94 million
in the third quarter of 2014. 

included
in the non-u.s. deferred tax expense are income tax benefits of $7 million in 2014 and $22 million in 2013 for losses from continuing operations for certain
jurisdictions with valuation allowances to the extent that income was recorded in other comprehensive income in that same

jurisdiction.
the benefit in 2014 was largely attributable to the u.k and the benefit in 2013 was largely attributable to switzerland. in both years, foreign currency gains and changes in pension
related items resulted in income in other comprehensive income where we have a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset. an offsetting income tax expense was recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

we
operate in over 40 non-u.s. tax jurisdictions with no specific country earning a predominant amount of our off-shore earnings. the vast majority of these countries have income tax
rates that are lower than the u.s. statutory rate. the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax losses was greater than the average statutory rate for countries with pre-tax income, resulting
in a net benefit as compared to the u.s. statutory rate. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the tax rate differential resulted in lower tax expense of $7 million, reflected in the
reconciliation above. 

in
certain non-u.s. tax jurisdictions, our u.s. gaap functional currency is different than the local tax currency. as a result, foreign exchange will always result in an impact to
tax expense. for 2014, this resulted in a $7 million tax benefit, as reflected in the reconciliation above. 


during
2012, we were granted a tax holiday for the period from january 1, 2012 through december 31, 2016 with respect to certain income from pigments products manufactured
in malaysia. we are required to make certain investments in order to enjoy the benefits of the tax holiday and we intend to make these investments. 

the
components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows (dollars in millions):

we
have gross nols of $3,411 million in various non-u.s. jurisdictions. while the majority of the non-u.s. nols have no expiration date, $1,174 million have a limited life
(of which $910 million are subject to a valuation allowance) and $124 million are scheduled to expire in 2015 (all of which are
subject to a valuation allowance). we had $14 million of gross nols expire unused in 2014 (all of which were subject to a valuation allowance). 


included
in the $3,411 million of gross non-u.s. nols is $877 million attributable to our luxembourg entities. as of december 31, 2014, there is a valuation
allowance of $209 million against these net tax-effected nols of $255 million. due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the benefits of these losses, we have reduced the
related deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance. 

we
evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by
jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets. these conclusions
require significant judgment. in

17. income taxes (continued) 

evaluating
the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of businesses and cumulative income or losses during the applicable period. cumulative losses incurred
over the period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. our judgments regarding valuation allowances are also influenced by the costs and risks
associated with any tax planning idea. 

during
2014, we released valuation allowances of $111 million and established valuation allowances of $3 million. in the u.s. we released $94 million of valuation
allowance on u.s. foreign tax credits as a result of making certain tax elections and filing amended u.s. tax returns and in luxembourg we released a valuation allowance on $6 million of
certain net deferred tax assets as a result of significant changes in estimated future taxable income resulting from increased intercompany receivables and, therefore, increased interest income in
luxembourg, our primary treasury center outside of the u.s. we established a valuation allowance of $3 million on certain net deferred tax assets in india as a result of closing operations in
one legal entity which will more likely than not result in the loss of its net operating losses. 

during
2013, we established valuation allowances of $95 million primarily on u.s. foreign tax credits as a result of insufficient foreign source income and we released valuation
allowances on $16 million of certain net deferred tax assets as a result of significant changes in estimated future taxable income resulting from increased intercompany receivables and,
therefore, increased interest income. 

during
2012, we released valuation allowances of $24 million on a portion of our net deferred tax assets in china, in certain u.s. states and in luxembourg, and we established
valuation allowances of
$23 million on certain net deferred tax assets in the u.s., india and indonesia. primarily as a result of a cumulative history of operating profits, we released the above noted valuation
allowances in china and certain u.s. state tax jurisdictions. a partial valuation allowance release was recognized in luxembourg for $12 million as a result of significant changes in estimated
future taxable income resulting from increased intercompany debt and, therefore, increased interest income in luxembourg. 


uncertainties
regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions and result in additional valuation
allowances in future periods, or, in the case of the unexpected pre-tax earnings, the release of valuation allowances in future periods.

as
of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $36 million and $78 million,
respectively. 

during
2014, 2013, and 2012, for unrecognized tax benefits that impact tax expense, we recorded a net increase in unrecognized tax benefits with a corresponding income tax expense of
$3 million, $9 million and $5 million, for each period. additional decreases in unrecognized tax benefits were offset by cash settlements or by a decrease in net deferred tax
assets and, therefore, did not affect income tax expense. 

in
accordance with our accounting policy, we continue to recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

17. income taxes (continued) 

we
conduct business globally and, as a result, we file income tax returns in u.s. federal, various u.s. state and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. the following table summarizes the tax
years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions: 
 













tax jurisdiction



 
 
open tax years 


china
 
2004 and later


france
 
2002 and later


india
 
2004 and later


italy
 
2010 and later

2008 and later


the netherlands
 
2009 and later


united kingdom
 
2012 and later


united states federal (except for foreign tax credits)
 
2009 and later



 
certain
of our u.s. and non-u.s. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities and the amounts ultimately agreed upon in resolution of the
issues raised may differ materially from the amounts accrued. 

we
estimate that it is reasonably possible that certain of our non-u.s. unrecognized tax benefits could change within 12 months of the reporting date with a resulting decrease in
the unrecognized tax benefits within a reasonably possible range of nil to $25 million. for the 12-month period from the reporting date, we would expect that a substantial portion of the
decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits would result in a corresponding benefit to our income tax expense. 

during
2014, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, china, france and
spain. during 2013, we concluded and settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, china, france and italy.
during 2012, we concluded and effectively settled tax examinations in the u.s. (both federal and various states) and various non-u.s. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, hong kong, thailand
and japan. 

for
non-u.s. entities that were not treated as branches for u.s. tax purposes, we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries that are reinvested
and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. we have material intercompany debt obligations owed by our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. we do not intend to
repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividend based on estimates of future domestic cash generation and our ability to return cash to the u.s. through payments of intercompany debt owned by our
non-u.s. subsidiaries to the u.s. to the extent that cash is required in the u.s., rather than repatriate earnings to the u.s. via dividends, we will repay certain of our intercompany debt. if any
earnings were repatriated via dividend, we may need to accrue and pay taxes on the distributions. 

as
discussed, we made a distribution of a portion of our earnings in 2013 when the amount of foreign tax credits associated with the distribution was greater than the amount of tax
otherwise due. the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries with positive earnings that are deemed to be permanently invested were approximately $307 million at december 31, 2014.
it is not practicable to

determine
the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings because of the significant assumptions necessary to compute the tax. 







18. commitments and contingencies  







purchase commitments  

we have various purchase commitments extending through 2027 for materials, supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of
business. included in the purchase commitments table below are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for 2014.
certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility. to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period,
such notice period has been included in the table below. the contractual purchase prices for substantially all of these contracts are variable based upon market prices, subject to annual negotiations.
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our current pricing for each contract. we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume
is purchased. we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made minimum payments of nil,
$7 million and nil, respectively, under such take or pay contracts without taking the product. 

total
purchase commitments as of december 31, 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):

operating lease agreements in our consolidated statements of operations is approximately $97 million, $80 million and $79 million for 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively, net of sublease rentals of approximately $3 million, $4 million and $4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.

legal matters  








antitrust matters  

we were named as a defendant in consolidated class action civil antitrust suits filed on february 9 and 12, 2010 in the u.s.
district court for the district of maryland alleging that we and our co-defendants and other alleged co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the u.s. between at least
march 1, 2002 and the present. the other defendants named in this matter were dupont, kronos and cristal (formerly millennium). on august 28, 2012, the court certified a class consisting
of all u.s. customers who purchased titanium dioxide directly from the defendants (the "direct purchasers") since february 1, 2003. we and all other defendants settled the direct purchasers
litigation and the court approved the settlement on december 13, 2013. we paid the settlement in an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. 

on
november 22, 2013, we were named as a defendant in a civil antitrust suit filed in the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota brought by a direct purchaser who opted
out of the direct purchasers class litigation (the "opt-out litigation"). on april 21, 2014, the court severed the claims against us from the other defendants sued and ordered our case
transferred to the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas. subsequently, kronos, another defendant, was also severed from the minnesota case and claims against it were transferred and
consolidated for trial with our case in the
southern district of texas. trial is scheduled for february 22, 2016. it is possible that additional claims will be filed by other direct purchasers who opted out of the class litigation.

18. commitments and contingencies (continued)  


we were also named as a defendant in a class action civil antitrust suit filed on march 15, 2013 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california by the
purchasers of products made from titanium dioxide (the "indirect purchasers") making essentially the same allegations as did the direct purchasers. on october 14, 2014, plaintiffs filed their
second amended class action complaint narrowing the class of plaintiffs to those merchants and consumers of architectural coatings containing titanium dioxide. plaintiffs have raised state antitrust
claims under the laws of 16 states, consumer protection claims under the laws of 10 states, as well as unjust enrichment claims under the laws of 20 states. the opt-out litigation and indirect
purchasers plaintiffs seek to recover injunctive relief, treble damages or the maximum damages allowed by state law, costs of suit and attorneys' fees. we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or
any of our employees. nevertheless, we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts which in the aggregate could be material to us. because of the overall
complexity of these cases, we are unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss associated with these claims and we have made no accruals with respect to these claims. 







product delivery claim  

we have been notified by a customer of potential claims related to our alleged delivery of a different product than the one the
customer had ordered. our customer claims that it was unaware that the different product had been delivered until after that product had been used to manufacture materials which were subsequently
sold. originally, the customer stated that it had been notified of claims by its customers of up to an aggregate of €153 million (approximately $187 million) relating to
this matter and claimed that we may be responsible for all or a portion of these potential claims. our customer has since resolved some of these claims and the aggregate amount of the current claims
is now approximately €113 million (approximately $138 million). based on the facts currently available, we believe that we are insured for any liability we may ultimately
have in excess of $10 million. however, no assurance can be given regarding our ultimate liability or costs. we believe our range of possible loss in this matter is between
€0 and €113 million (approximately $138 million), and we have made no accrual with respect to this matter. 







indemnification matters  

on july 3, 2012, deutsche bank securities inc. and credit suisse securities (usa) llc, demanded that we indemnify
them for claims brought against them by certain matlinpatterson entities that were formerly our stockholders ("matlinpatterson") in litigation filed by matlinpatterson on june 19, 2012 in the
9th district court in montgomery county, texas (the "texas litigation"). the banks assert that they are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the agreement of compromise and settlement
between the banks and our company, dated june 22, 2009, wherein the banks and our company settled claims that we filed relating to the failed acquisition by and merger with hexion.
matlinpatterson claims that the banks knowingly made materially false representations about the nature of the financing for the acquisition of our company by hexion and that they suffered substantial
loss in value to their 19 million shares of our common stock as a result thereof. matlinpatterson is asserting statutory fraud, common law fraud and aiding and abetting statutory fraud and are
seeking actual damages, exemplary damages, costs and attorney's fees and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. on december 21, 2012, the court dismissed the texas litigation, a decision
which was affirmed

18. commitments and contingencies (continued) 

by
the ninth court of appeals of texas on may 15, 2014. a subsequent motion for rehearing by matlinpatterson was denied by the same appellate court on june 12, 2014. a petition for
discretionary review in the texas supreme court was filed on july 28, 2014 and is currently pending. 


on
july 14, 2014, the banks demanded that we indemnify them for additional claims brought against them by certain other former company stockholders in litigation filed
june 14, 2014 in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin (the "wisconsin litigation"). the stockholders in the wisconsin litigation have made essentially the same
allegations as matlinpatterson made in the texas litigation and, additionally, have named apollo global management llc and apollo management holdings, l.p. as defendants. stockholder
plaintiffs in the wisconsin litigation assert claims for misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud. on december 23, 2014, the banks filed motions to dismiss the wisconsin litigation on the
same grounds asserted in the texas litigation. the court has not ruled on these motions. we denied the banks' indemnification demand for both the texas litigation and the wisconsin litigation. 







other proceedings  

we are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under
provisions of applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these
matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 







19. environmental, health and safety matters  







general  

we are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety,
pollution, protection of the environment, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
waste materials. in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. in
addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. actual or alleged violations of safety laws,
environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as, under some
environmental laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us
to modify our facilities or operations. accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. 







environmental, health and safety systems  

we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable ehs legal requirements, and we have developed policies and
management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with 

f-80




 

table of contents


huntsman corporation and subsidiaries 

huntsman international llc and subsidiaries 

notes to consolidated financial statements (continued) 







19. environmental, health and safety matters (continued) 

applicable
legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. although ehs
legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency
and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. 







ehs capital expenditures  

we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and
repair pollution control equipment. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled $125 million, $92 million, and
$105 million, respectively. because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of
specific requirements, our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future
amounts we may spend related to ehs and other applicable laws. 

we
have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties
at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that
was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. 

under
cercla and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property in the u.s. may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal
of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the
release. outside the u.s., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in france and australia, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities.
currently, there are approximately 10 former facilities or third-party sites in the u.s. for which we have been notified of potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not
limited to, sites listed under cercla. based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites, we do not expect these third-party claims to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

one
of these sites, the north maybe canyon mine site, involves a former phosphorous mine near soda springs, idaho, which is believed to have been operated by several companies, including
a predecessor company to us. in 2004, the u.s. forest service notified us that we are a cercla prp for contamination originating from the site. in february 2010, we and wells cargo (another prp)
agreed to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study of a portion of the site and are currently engaged in that process. at this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate our potential
liabilities at this site. 

another
of these sites, the star lake canal site in port neches, tx, involves a discharge point for manufacturing facilities owned by us and several other local chemical manufacturers.
the epa issued a draft consent decree related to cleanup at this site to us and a prior owner in september 2014. the prior owner has an indemnification obligation and has accepted defense of this
matter. as of

19. environmental, health and safety matters (continued) 

december 31,
2014, we had an accrued liability of approximately $18 million relating to this matter and a corresponding receivable of approximately $18 million relating to our
indemnity protection. 

in
addition, under rcra in the u.s. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit.
some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. we are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from
past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. for example, our port neches, texas, and geismar, louisiana, facilities are the subject of ongoing
remediation requirements imposed under rcra. similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing facilities, such as australia, india,
france, hungary and italy.

letter dated march 7, 2006, our former base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray, australia was issued a cleanup notice by epa victoria due to concerns about soil
and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. on august 23, 2010, epa victoria revoked a second cleanup notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial
assurance for the remediation. as of december 31, 2014, we had an accrued liability of approximately $19 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site. we can
provide no assurance that the authority will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be required for the cleanup. 

in
many cases, our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility.
in these situations, we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. we have successfully exercised our
rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liability. we cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such
matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters. 

based
on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not
have a material effect on our financial statements. however, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to
such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. at the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to
remediate any of the known contamination sites. 







environmental reserves  

we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known
penalties. liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. our liability estimates are calculated using present value
techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. the environmental liabilities

do
not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations. we had accrued $60 million and $27 million for environmental liabilities as of december 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. of these amounts, $7 million and $5 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
and $53 million and $22 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in certain
cases, our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to
estimate the amount or range of such potential excess. 

on
october 1, 2014, the company completed the rockwood acquisition. the properties involved in the transaction are located primarily in china, finland, germany, italy, the united
kingdom and the u.s., and include both owned and leased sites. the existence of soil and groundwater contamination from historical industrial operations is known to exist at some of these new
properties. as of december 31, 2014, these newly acquired businesses had accrued $17 million for environmental liabilities (including remediations, investigations, groundwater
monitoring, and reclamation obligations associated with landfill operations). of this amount, $3 million was classified as accrued liabilities and $14 million was classified as other
noncurrent liabilities. in certain cases, these remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to 30 years. the company is currently evaluating these new reserve amounts in relation
to similar reserves recorded by the company in the past, as well as within the context of the terms of the acquisition agreements. pursuant to the agreements related to the rockwood acquisition,
rockwood has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental matters. 







regulatory developments  

the european union regulatory framework for chemicals, called "reach," became effective in 2007 and is designed to be phased in
gradually over 11 years. as a reach-regulated company that manufactures in or imports more than one metric ton per year of a chemical substance into the european economic area, we were required
to pre-register with the european chemicals agency such chemical substances and isolated intermediates to take advantage of the 11 year phase-in period. to meet our compliance obligations, a
cross-business reach team was established, through which we were able to fulfill all required pre-registrations, our first phase registrations by the november 30, 2010 deadline and our second
phase registrations by the may 31, 2013 deadline. while we continue our registration efforts to meet the next registration deadline of may 31, 2018, our reach implementation team is now
strategically focused on the evaluation and authorization phases of the reach process, directing its efforts to address "substances of very high concern" and evaluating potential business
implications. where warranted, evaluation of substitute chemicals will be an important element of our ongoing manufacturing sustainability efforts. as a chemical manufacturer with global operations,
we are also actively monitoring and addressing analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the european union, such as in korea and taiwan. 

although
the total long-term cost for reach compliance is unknown at this time, we spent approximately $5 million, $4 million and $8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, to meet the initial reach requirements. we cannot provide assurance that these recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts that we may be required to spend for reach compliance.

greenhouse gas regulation  

globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of ghg, such as carbon dioxide and
methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth's climate. at the durban negotiations of the conference of the parties to the kyoto protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including
the european union, agreed to a second commitment period for the kyoto protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in ghg emissions. more significantly, the european union ghg
emissions trading system, established pursuant to the kyoto protocol to reduce ghg emissions in the european union, continues in its third phase. the european union parliament continues with a process
to formalized "backloading"—the withholding of ghg allowances to prop up carbon prices. in addition, the european union has recently announced its intentions to cut ghg emissions to 40%
below 1990 levels by 2040 and impose a 27% renewable energy requirement at the european union level. in the u.s., california has commenced the first compliance period of its cap-and-trade program. in
june 2013, china implemented its first pilot carbon emissions exchange in shenzhen, china. pilot carbon emissions schemes have also begun in beijing, shanghai, guangdong, and tianjin. further
expansion of china's regional cap-and-trade is planned, and ultimately it is expected that these regional systems will form the backbone of a national cap-and-trade program. as these programs have not
been fully implemented and have experienced significant price volatility on low early trading volumes, we are unable at this time to determine their impact on our operations. 

federal
climate change legislation in the u.s. appears unlikely in the near-term. as a result, domestic efforts to curb ghg emissions will continue to be led by the epa's ghg regulations
and the efforts of states. to the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the epa's ghg regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded
facilities. significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the caa's prevention of significant deterioration requirements under the epa's ghg
"tailoring rule." some of our facilities are also subject to the epa's mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs. 

under
a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the epa is due to propose new source performance standards for ghg emissions from refineries. these standards could
significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined products. either of these events could have an
adverse effect on our business. 

we
are already managing and reporting ghg emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and/or european union
emissions trading scheme requirements. although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs,
although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time. potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission
restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact
of potential future regulation on any of our sites.

finally,
it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant
physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our
assets and operations. 







20. huntsman corporation stockholders' equity  







dividends on common stock  

during the quarters ended december 31, 2014 and september 30, 2014, we paid cash dividends of $30 million and
$31 million, respectively, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders, and during each of the quarters ended june 30, 2014 and march 31, 2014, we paid cash dividends of
$30 million, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders for a total of $121 million of cash dividends paid during 2014. during each quarter of 2013, we paid cash dividends of
$30 million, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders for a total of $120 million of cash dividends paid during 2013. 







21. stock-based compensation plan  


under the stock incentive plan, a plan approved by stockholders, we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, phantom
stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock options may be
granted solely to employees. the terms of the grants are fixed at the grant date. as of december 31, 2014 we were authorized to grant up to 37.2 million shares under the stock incentive
plan. as of december 31, 2014, we had 9 million shares remaining under the stock incentive plan available for grant. option awards have a maximum contractual term of 10 years and
generally must have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of our common stock on the date the option award is granted. stock-based awards generally vest over a three-year period. 


the
compensation cost from continuing operations under the stock incentive plan for our company and huntsman international were as follows (dollars in millions):

stock options  

the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes valuation model that uses the
assumptions noted in the following table. expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock through the grant date. the expected term of options granted was estimated
based on the contractual term of the instruments
and employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the u.s. treasury yield curve
in effect at the time of grant. the assumptions noted below represent the weighted averages of the assumptions utilized for all stock options granted during the year.

the
weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $9.63, $7.93 and $6.36 per option, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, there
was $11 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option arrangements granted under the stock incentive plan. that cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. 

during
the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $14 million, $14 million and $10 million,

(1)as
of december 31, 2014, a total of 388,299 restricted stock units were vested but not yet issued, of which 44,534 vested during 2014. these shares
have not been reflected as vested shares in this table because, in accordance with the restricted stock unit agreements, shares of common stock are not issued for vested restricted stock units until
termination of employment.  
 
as
of december 31, 2014, there was $22 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share compensation arrangements granted under the stock
incentive plan. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. the value of share awards that vested during the years ended
december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $19 million, $18 million and $21 million, respectively.

our
subsidiary airstar corporation ("airstar") subleases a gulfstream iv-sp aircraft (the "aircraft") from jstar corporation ("jstar"), a corporation wholly owned by jon m.
huntsman pursuant to a lease arrangement that expires in 2021. jon m. huntsman is the executive chairman and the father of our chief executive officer, peter r. huntsman, and our
director, jon m. huntsman, jr. under this arrangement, monthly sublease payments from airstar to jstar are approximately $115,000, and an aggregate of $10 million is payable through the
end of the remaining seven year lease term. these monthly sublease payments are equal to the financing costs paid by jstar to a leasing company and the arrangement does not result in a financial
benefit to jstar. 

we
occupy and use a portion of an office building owned by the huntsman foundation, a private charitable foundation established by jon m. and karen h. huntsman to further
the charitable interests of the huntsman family, under a lease pursuant to which we make annual lease payments of approximately $2 million. during each of the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012,
we made payments of approximately $2 million to the huntsman foundation under the lease. the lease expires on december 31, 2018, subject to a five-year extension, at our option. 


through
may 2002, we paid the premiums on various life insurance policies for jon m. huntsman. these policies have been liquidated, and the cash values have been paid to
mr. huntsman. mr. huntsman is indebted to us in the amount of approximately $2 million with accrued interest, which represents the insurance premiums paid on his behalf through
may 2002. this amount is included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 







24. operating segment information  


we derive our revenues, earnings and cash flows from the manufacture and sale of a wide variety of differentiated and commodity chemical products. we have reported our operations through
five segments: polyurethanes, performance products, advanced materials, textile effects and pigments and additives. we have organized our business and derived our operating segments around differences
in product lines.

(1)during
the three months ended september 30, 2014, as a result of extensive research and analysis, we filed amended u.s. tax returns for tax years
2008 through 2012, along with our original u.s. tax return for tax year 2013, and made elections which allowed us to utilize u.s. foreign tax credits. as a result of utilizing these assets that had
been subject to a valuation allowance, we recognized a discrete income tax benefit of $94 million in the third quarter of 2014.
(2)basic
and diluted income per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during that period. therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share.
