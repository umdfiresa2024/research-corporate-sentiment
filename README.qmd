# 1. Introduction

Understanding the impact of environmental corporate sentiment on changes in greenhouse gas emissions emphasizes the importance of environmental communication. By connecting how companies communicate their environmental sentiment with changes in their operation’s greenhouse gas emissions, policymakers can better understand the impact of regulation that requires ecological communication. This connection presents an opportunity to encourage companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and show society their corporate environmental sentiment. This type of communication will become more important as countries look factor pollution output into the costs of production to clean domestic manufacturing. It will also further our knowledge on differentiating honest environmental sentiment that is acted upon as reflected by their pollution levels compared to “cheap talk” (Bingler et al., 2024). Through our data, we hold companies more accountable for their communications of their environmental impacts. By examining greenhouse gas emissions we can narrow our focus to directly connecting a company's sentiment of their pollution to the actual emissions they generate.

# 2. Literature Review

-   Presently, much work has been done on discerning genuine climate commitments and ‘cheap talk’. Current research concludes that firms with poor environmental action tend to communicate more environmental goals to “distract from poor performance” (Preuss & Max, 2023). This means that policies that intend to generate environmental commitments need to require clarity from companies if they want genuine environmental communications from companies. Identifying specific and genuine environmental communications has been done through ClimateBert’s environmental claims detection model.

-   Our research uses the zero-emissions BERT large language model created by (Bingler et al. 2024), to detect sentences with planned GHG reduction sentiments and combine the output with GHG emissions to evaluate if a company’s pollution reflects their sentiment.

-   Our research scans corporate communications from companies for sentences containing emissions information and changes in their corresponding pollution measured by the government. By examining these two variables we will see if companies support their environmental claims through changes in their emission levels.

# 3 Data

## 3.1 FLIGHT

The EPA FLIGHT data set shows the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for large facilities. Using this data set, the environmental impact of each company can be quantified. In order to match these companies, to 10-K reports, the company list from FLIGHT is fed into Chat GPT. Relating the GHG emissions from these companies from the past 10 years to corporate sentiment from SEC EDGAR 10-K reports, a score can be determined for each company.

## 3.2 SEC EDGAR

10-K documents summarize a company's financial performance and other important information including their environmental and emissions activity. By scraping the SEC EDGAR database, 10-K reports were collected for each company and then parsed by sentence to create a data collection of spreadsheets containing each sentence from each 10-K.
