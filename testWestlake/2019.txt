"we," "our," "us" or like terms refer to westlake chemical corporation ("westlake" or the "company").cautionary statements about forward-looking statementsthe private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions for forward-looking information. certain of the statements contained in this form 10-k are forward-looking statements. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this form 10-k that address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believes," "intends," "may," "should," "could," "anticipates," "expected" or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategies or trends. although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. forward-looking statements relate to matters such as: •future operating rates, margins, cash flows and demand for our products;•industry market outlook, including the price of crude oil;•production capacities;•currency devaluation;•our ability to borrow additional funds under our credit agreement;•our ability to meet our liquidity needs;•our ability to meet debt obligations under our debt instruments;•our intended quarterly dividends;•future capacity additions and expansions in the industries in which we compete;•results of acquisitions;•timing, funding and results of capital projects;•pension plan obligations, funding requirements and investment policies;•compliance with present and future environmental regulations and costs associated with environmentally-related penalties, capital expenditures, remedial actions and proceedings, including any new laws, regulations or treaties that may come into force to limit or control carbon dioxide and other ghg emissions or to address other issues of climate change;•effects of pending legal proceedings; and•timing of and amount of capital expenditures.we have based these statements on assumptions and analyses in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe were appropriate in the circumstances when the statements were made. forward-looking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such statements. while it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties. among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed under "risk factors" and those described from time to time in our other filings with the sec including, but not limited to, the following: •general economic and business conditions;•the cyclical nature of the chemical and building products industries;•the availability, cost and volatility of raw materials and energy;•uncertainties associated with the united states, european and worldwide economies, including those due to political tensions and unrest in the middle east and elsewhere;•current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and other countries;•industry production capacity and operating rates;•the supply/demand balance for our products;•competitive products and pricing pressures;itable of contents•instability in the credit and financial markets;•access to capital markets;•terrorist acts;•operating interruptions (including leaks, explosions, fires, weather-related incidents, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, spills and releases and other environmental risks);•changes in laws or regulations, including trade policies;•technological developments;•foreign currency exchange risks;•our ability to implement our business strategies; and•creditworthiness of our customers.many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. any of the factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels. every forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.industry and market data industry and market data used throughout this form 10-k were obtained through internal company research, surveys and studies conducted by unrelated third parties and publicly available industry and general publications, including information from ihs markit ("ihs"). we have not independently verified market and industry data from external sources. while we believe internal company estimates are reliable and market definitions are appropriate, neither such estimates nor these definitions have been verified by any independent sources. production capacity unless we state otherwise, annual production capacity estimates used throughout this form 10-k represent rated capacity of the facilities at december 31, 2019. we calculated rated capacity by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate, after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance, and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit's optimal daily output based on the design feedstock mix. because the rated capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount, actual production volumes may be more or less than the rated capacity. iitable of contentspart iitem 1. businessgeneralwe are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. our products include some of the most widely used materials in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, water treatment, refrigerants, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. we operate in two principal operating segments, olefins and vinyls. we are highly integrated along our olefins product chain with significant downstream integration into polyethylene and styrene monomer. we are also an integrated global producer of vinyls with substantial downstream integration into polyvinyl chloride ("pvc") building products.we began operations in 1986 after our first polyethylene plant, an olefins segment business, near lake charles, louisiana was acquired from occidental petroleum corporation. we began our vinyls operations in 1990 with the acquisition of a vinyl chloride monomer ("vcm") plant in calvert city, kentucky from the b.f.goodrich company. in 1992, we commenced our vinyls segment's building products operations after acquiring three pvc pipe plants. since 1986, we have grown rapidly into an integrated global producer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. we achieved this growth by acquiring existing plants or constructing new plants and completing numerous capacity or production line expansions. we regularly consider acquisitions and other internal and external growth opportunities that would be consistent with, or complementary to, our overall business strategy.in 2014, we formed westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. also in 2014, westlake partners completed an initial public offering. as of february 12, 2020, westlake partners' assets consisted of a 22.8% limited partner interest in westlake chemical opco lp ("opco"), as well as the general partner interest in opco. prior to the westlake partners ipo, opco's assets were wholly-owned by us. opco's assets include two ethylene production facilities at our olefins facility in lake charles, one ethylene production facility at our calvert city site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from mont belvieu, texas to the longview, texas site, which includes our longview polyethylene production facility. we retain a 77.2% limited partner interest in opco, a 40.1% limited partner interest in westlake partners (consisting of 14,122,230 common units), a general partner interest in westlake partners and incentive distribution rights. the operations of westlake partners are consolidated in our financial statements. we are party to certain agreements with westlake partners and opco whereby, among other things, opco sells us 95% of the ethylene it produces on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10. we use this ethylene in the production processes of both our olefins and vinyls segments. for more information, see "—olefins business" and "—vinyls business" below.on january 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of nakantm, a global compounding solutions business. nakan's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries. with this acquisition, our compounding business now has facilities worldwide in china, france, germany, italy, japan, mexico, spain, the united states and vietnam, as well as a world-class research facility in france and several application laboratories. on november 12, 2019, we, through one of our subsidiaries, eagle us 2 llc ("eagle"), completed the acquisition of an additional 34.8% of the membership interests in lacc, llc ("lacc") from lotte chemical usa corporation, a subsidiary of lotte chemical corporation ("lotte"), for approximately $817 million (the "transaction"). prior to the transaction, eagle owned approximately 12% of the membership interests in lacc. as of december 31, 2019, we owned an aggregate 46.8% membership interest in lacc. the lacc ethylene plant has 2.2 billion pounds per year of ethylene production capacity and is adjacent to our chlor-alkali facility in lake charles. during the third quarter of 2019, the lacc ethylene plant began commercial operations. as a result of the transaction, we will receive our proportionate share of lacc's ethylene production on a cash-cost basis, which is expected to benefit our integrated downstream operations.we benefit from highly integrated production facilities that allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added chemicals and building products. as of february 12, 2020, we (directly and through opco, our investment in lacc, and our 95%- and 60%-owned joint ventures in china and taiwan, respectively) had approximately 44.0 billion pounds per year of aggregate production capacity at numerous manufacturing sites in north america, europe and asia.1table of contentsolefins businessproductsolefins are the basic building blocks used to create a wide variety of petrochemical products. we manufacture ethylene (through opco), polyethylene, styrene and associated co-products at our manufacturing facility in lake charles and polyethylene at our longview facility. we have two ethylene plants, which are owned by opco, two polyethylene plants and one styrene monomer plant at our olefins facility in lake charles. we have three polyethylene plants and a specialty polyethylene wax plant at our longview site.the following table

produce a large number of higher value-added chemicals including polyethylene, edc, vcm and styrene. opco has the capacity to produce approximately 3.0 billion pounds of ethylene per year at our olefins facility at our lake charles site, and we have the capability to consume all of opco's production that we purchase at lake charles to produce polyethylene and styrene monomer in our olefins business and to produce vcm and edc in our vinyls business. opco also produces ethylene for our vinyls segment at our calvert city site, and substantially all of the ethylene we purchase from opco at calvert city is used internally in the production of vcm. for opco's annual ethylene production that is purchased by us for our vinyls business, see "business—vinyls business." in addition, we (through opco) produce ethylene co-products including chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. we (through opco) sell our entire output of these co-products to external customers.polyethylene. polyethylene, the world's most widely consumed polymer, is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of film, coatings and molded product applications primarily used in packaging. polyethylene is generally classified as either ldpe, lldpe or high-density polyethylene ("hdpe"). the density correlates to the relative stiffness of the end-use products. the difference between ldpe and lldpe is molecular, and products produced from lldpe, in general, have higher strength properties than products produced from ldpe. ldpe exhibits better clarity and other physical properties and is used in end products such as bread bags, food wraps, milk carton coatings and food packaging. lldpe is used for higher film strength applications such as stretch film and heavy duty sacks. hdpe is used to manufacture products such as grocery, merchandise and trash bags, rigid plastic containers, plastic closures and pipe.2table of contentswe are the second-largest producer of ldpe by capacity in north america and predominantly use the autoclave technology (versus tubular technology), which is capable of producing higher-margin specialty polyethylene products. in 2019, our annual capacity of approximately 1.5 billion pounds was available in numerous formulations to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. we also have the capacity to produce approximately 1.1 billion pounds of lldpe per year in various formulations. we produce ldpe and lldpe at both the lake charles and longview facilities. our lake charles and longview facilities also have the capability to produce hdpe. we sell polyethylene to external customers as a final product in pellet form.styrene. styrene is used to produce derivatives such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, unsaturated polyester and synthetic rubber. these derivatives are used in a number of applications including consumer disposables, food packaging, housewares, paints and coatings, building materials, tires and toys. we produce styrene at our lake charles plant, where we have the capacity to produce approximately 570 million pounds of styrene per year, all of which is sold to external customers.feedstockswe are highly integrated along our olefins product chain. we (through opco) produce most of the ethylene required to produce our polyethylene and styrene. ethylene can be produced from either petroleum liquid feedstocks, such as naphtha, condensates and gas oils, or from natural gas liquid feedstocks, such as ethane, propane and butane. both of opco's lake charles ethylene plants use ethane as the primary feedstock. pursuant to a feedstock supply agreement between us and opco, opco receives ethane feedstock at the olefins facility at our lake charles site through several pipelines from a variety of suppliers in texas and louisiana. we own a 50% interest in a 104-mile natural gas liquids pipeline from mont belvieu to our lake charles site. opco owns a 200-mile ethylene pipeline that runs from mont belvieu to our longview site.in addition to ethylene supplied by opco, we also acquire ethylene from third parties in order to supply a portion of our vinyls segment ethylene requirements. we acquire butene and hexene to manufacture polyethylene and benzene to manufacture styrene. we receive butene and hexene at the lake charles site and hexene at the longview site via rail car from several suppliers. we receive benzene via barges, ships and pipeline pursuant to short-term arrangements. we purchase butene and hexene pursuant to multi-year contracts, some of which are renewable for an additional term subject to either party to the contract notifying the other party that it does not wish to renew the contract. we purchase electricity for our lake charles facility under long-term industrial contracts.marketing, sales and distributionwe have an internal sales force that sells our products directly to our customers. our polyethylene customers are some of the nation's largest producers of film and flexible packaging.we and opco sell ethylene and ethylene co-products to external customers. opco's primary ethylene co-products are chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. we have storage agreements and exchange agreements that allow us and opco access to customers who are not directly connected to the pipeline system that we own. opco ships crude butadiene and pyrolysis gasoline by rail or truck. additionally, we transport our polyethylene and styrene by rail or truck. further, styrene can be transported by barge or ship.no single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the olefins segment in 2019. competitionthe markets in which our olefins business operates are highly competitive. we compete on the basis of customer service, product deliverability, quality, consistency, performance and price. our competitors in the ethylene, polyethylene and styrene markets are

materials such as glass, metal, wood, concrete and other plastic materials because of its versatility, durability and cost-competitiveness. pvc is produced from vcm, which is, in turn, made from chlorine and ethylene. pvc compounds are highly customized formulations that offer specific end-use properties based on customer-determined manufacturing specifications. pvc compounds are made by combining pvc resin with various additives in order to make either rigid and impact-resistant or soft and flexible compounds. the various compounds are then fabricated into end-products through extrusion, calendering, injection-molding or blow-molding. we are the second-largest pvc producer in the world. with the completion of our previously announced expansion projects at our geismar and burghausen plants in 2019, we have the capacity to produce approximately 6.7 billion pounds and 1.1 billion pounds of commodity and specialty pvc per year, respectively, at our various facilities globally. we use some of our pvc internally in the production of our building products and pvc compounds. the remainder of our pvc is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets.vcm. vcm is used to produce pvc, solvents and pvc-related products. we use ethylene and chlorine to produce edc, which is used in turn, to produce vcm. we have the capacity to produce approximately 6.1 billion pounds and 1.5 billion pounds of vcm per year at our north american and european facilities, respectively. the majority of our vcm is used internally in our pvc operations. vcm and edc not used internally are sold externally.chlorine and caustic soda. we combine salt and electricity to produce chlorine and caustic soda, commonly referred to as chlor-alkali, at our lake charles, plaquemine, natrium, calvert city, geismar, beauharnois, longview (wa), gendorf, knapsack and kaohsiung facilities. we are the second-largest chlor-alkali producer in the world. we use our chlorine production in our vcm and chlorinated derivative products plants. we currently have the capacity to supply all of our chlorine requirements internally. any remaining chlorine is sold into the merchant chlorine market. our caustic soda is sold to external customers who use it for, among other things, the production of pulp and paper, organic and inorganic chemicals and alumina.chlorinated derivative products. our chlorinated derivative products include ethyl chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tri-ethane® solvents, versatrans® solvents, calcium hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid ("hcl") and pelletized caustic soda ("pels"). we have the capacity to produce approximately 2.3 billion pounds of chlorinated derivative products per year, primarily at our lake charles, natrium, beauharnois and longview (wa) facilities. the majority of our chlorinated derivative products are sold to external customers who use these products for, among other things, refrigerants, water treatment applications, chemicals and pharmaceutical production, food processing, steel pickling, solvent and cleaning chemicals and natural gas and oil production.ethylene. we utilize ethylene from opco's facility in calvert city and lacc to produce vcm at our facilities. we obtain the remainder of the ethylene we need for our vinyls business from third party purchases. the use of ethane feedstock by our ethylene plants enables us to enhance our low cost vinyl chain integration. building products and pvc compounds. products made from pvc are used in materials ranging from water and sewer systems to home and commercial applications for siding, trim, mouldings, deck, window and door profiles. our building products consist of two primary product groups: (i) exterior products, which includes siding, trim, mouldings, window profiles, decking products and roofing applications; and (ii) pvc pipe, specialty pvc pipe and fittings. we manufacture and market exterior products under the royal building products®, celect cellular exteriors by royal®, zuri premium decking by royal®, royal s4s trim board®, exterior portfolio® and davinci® brand names. we manufacture and market specialty pipe and fittings, water, sewer, irrigation and conduit pipe products under the napcotm brand name. we manufacture film and sheet at our shanghai facility for both asian and global markets. flexible pvc compounds are used for wire and cable insulation, medical films and packaging, flooring, wall coverings, automotive interior and exterior trims and packaging. rigid extrusion pvc compounds are commonly used in window and door profiles, vertical blinds and construction products, including pipe and siding. injection-molding pvc compounds are used in specialty products such as computer housings and keyboards, appliance parts and containers. powder compounds are primarily used in window and door profiles and pipe and fittings. the combined capacity of our 36 building products and pvc compounds plants is approximately 3.4 billion pounds per year.electricity. our lake charles, plaquemine and natrium cogeneration assets have the capacity to generate electricity of approximately 420, 240 and 100 megawatts, respectively, per year. our north american joint ventures include a 50% interest in rs cogen llc ("rs cogen") that generates electricity, of which our share is approximately 212 megawatts. 6table of contentsfeedstocks we are highly integrated along our vinyls production chain. we produce most of the ethylene required at our calvert city and lake charles facilities utilizing ethane feedstock. the lacc ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in lake charles and has an ethylene production capacity of 2.2 billion pounds per year. during the third quarter of 2019, the lacc ethylene plant began its commercial operations. at december 31, 2019, we, through one of our subsidiaries, own 46.8% of the membership interests in lacc. we receive our proportionate share in ethylene production on a cash-cost basis and primarily use it to produce vcm. in germany, we have access to, and partially own, an ethylene pipeline. the salt requirements for several of our larger chlor-alkali plants are supplied internally from salt domes we either own or lease and is transported by pipelines we own. we purchase the salt required for our other chlor-alkali plants pursuant to long-term contracts. electricity and steam for one of our lake charles facilities are produced by both on-site cogeneration units and through a toll arrangement with rs cogen, a joint venture in which we own a 50% interest. rs cogen operates a process steam, natural gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacent to the site. electricity and steam for the plaquemine facility is supplied internally by our on-site cogeneration unit. a portion of our natrium facility's electricity requirements is produced by our on-site generation unit, and the remainder is purchased. we purchase electricity for our remaining facilities under long-term contracts. we purchase vcm for our asian pvc plant on a contract and spot basis. our north american and asian pvc facilities supply predominantly all of the pvc required for our building products plants. pvc required for the pvc compounds plants is either internally sourced or externally purchased at market prices based on the location of the plants. the remaining feedstocks include pigments, fillers, stabilizers and other ingredients, which we purchase under short-term contracts based on prevailing market prices.marketing, sales and distributionwe have a dedicated sales force for our business, organized by product line and region. in addition, we rely on distributors to market products to smaller customers. we use some of our pvc internally in the production of our building products and pvc compounds. the remainder of our pvc is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets. we have the capacity to use a majority of our chlorine internally to produce vcm and edc, most of which, in turn, is used to produce pvc. we also use our chlorine internally to produce chlorinated derivative products. we sell the remainder of our chlorine and substantially all of our caustic soda production to external customers. the majority of our products are shipped from production facilities directly to the customer via pipeline, truck, rail, barge and/or ship. the remaining products are shipped from production facilities to third party chemical terminals and warehouses until being sold to customers.we are the second largest manufacturer of pvc pipe by capacity in north america. we sell a majority of our siding, trim and mouldings products, pvc pipe, specialty pvc pipe and fittings, and film and sheet products through a combination of our internal sales force and manufacturer's representatives. in canada, we operate 18 company-owned distribution branches that sell our vinyl siding and accessories and trim and mouldings products, as well as pipe and fittings. we also engage in advertising programs primarily directed at trade professionals that are intended to develop awareness and interest in our products. in addition, we display our building products at trade shows.no single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the vinyls segment in 2019.competitionthe markets in which our vinyls business operates are highly competitive. competition in the vinyls market is based on product availability, product performance, customer service and price. we compete in the vinyls market with other producers including formosa plastics corporation, oxy chem, lp, shintech, inc., olin corporation, geon performance solutions, teknor apex company, inc., orbia advanced corporation, s.a.b. de c.v., inovyn chlorvinyls limited, vynova group and kem one group sas.competition in the building products market is based on on-time delivery, product quality, product innovation, customer service, product consistency and price. we compete in the building products market with other producers and fabricators including diamond plastics corporation, jm eagle inc., cornerstone building brands, inc., certainteed corporation, ipex inc., associated materials llc and the azek company.7table of contentsenvironmentalas is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business. national, state or provincial and local standards regulating air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. compliance with such laws and regulations has required and will continue to require capital expenditures and increase operating costs.it is our policy to comply with all environmental, health and safety requirements and to provide safe and environmentally sound workplaces for our employees. in some cases, compliance can be achieved only by incurring capital expenditures. in 2019, we made capital expenditures of $28 million related to environmental compliance. we estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $40 million in 2020 and $34 million in 2021, respectively, related to environmental compliance. the expected 2020 and 2021 capital expenditures are relatively higher than the amounts we have spent related to environmental compliance in recent years in large part due to capital expenditures related to environmental protection agency (the "epa") regulations. the remainder of the 2020 and 2021 estimated expenditures are related to equipment replacement and upgrades. we anticipate that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general. although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures, management believes that our current spending trends will continue.from time to time, we receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. item 103 of the sec's regulation s-k requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, unless we reasonably believe such sanctions would not exceed $100,000.•in may 2013, an amendment to an existing consent order agreed to by the west virginia department of environmental protection and a predecessor of axiall required that it, among other things, pay a penalty in the amount of $449,000 and continue certain corrective actions associated with discharges of hexachlorocyclohexane (commonly referred to as bhc) from the natrium facility's effluent discharge outfalls. the penalty was paid and corrective actions required are on-going per a december 2018 agreement to extend the compliance date under the amended consent order. the amended consent order also imposes stipulated penalties for exceedances of the facility's interim effluent discharge limits, which penalties we believe may, in the aggregate, reach or exceed $100,000.•during september 2010, our vinyls facilities in lake charles and plaquemine each received a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty, alleging violations of various requirements of those facilities' air permits, based largely on self-reported permit deviations related to record-keeping violations. in may 2018, we reached an agreement in principal with the louisiana department of environmental quality to resolve these consolidated enforcement matters for a penalty of $162,500. the settlement agreement is subject to public comment and approval by the louisiana attorney general. •for several years, the epa has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. on april 21, 2014, we received a clean air act section 114 information request from the epa which sought information regarding flares at the calvert city facility and certain lake charles facilities. the epa has informed us that the information provided leads the epa to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. the epa has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate us to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. we believe the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.•region six of the epa has investigated and inspected our compliance with risk management program requirements under the clean air act at our geismar facility. in november 2019, we reached an agreement in principle with the epa to resolve this matter by consent agreement and final order for a penalty in the amount of $132,000, in addition to a supplemental environmental project with a cost to us of $116,200.•on november 15, 2019, the epa issued a notice of violation and opportunity to show cause letter alleging violations of certain requirements under the toxic substances control act identified during the agency's inspection of one of our lake charles facilities. we believe the resolution of this matter may require payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.•on november 24, 2014, we entered into an agreed order with the kentucky energy and environmental cabinet ("keec") regarding our kentucky pollutant discharge elimination system permit limits for hexachlorobenzene 8table of contentsand mercury at our calvert city, kentucky facility. we and the keec entered into a new agreed order under which we will be subject to new interim discharge limits for hexachlorobenzene in addition to accompanying stipulated penalties for exceedances of those interim discharge limits, which penalties we believe may, in the aggregate, reach or exceed $100,000.we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.also see our discussion of our environmental matters contained in item 1a, "risk factors" below, item 3, "legal proceedings" below and note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.employees as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately 9,430 employees in the following areas: category numberolefins segment 840vinyls segment 8,250corporate and other 340approximately 38% of our employees are represented by labor unions, and all of these union employees are working under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times through 2024. we have multiple collective bargaining agreements in europe, north america and asia, covering different groups of our work force. there were no strikes, lockouts or work stoppages in 2019, and we believe that our relationship with our employees and unions is open and positive.technology historically, our technology strategy has been to selectively acquire licenses from third-parties, as well as develop our own proprietary technology. our selection process incorporates many factors, including the cost of the technology, the ability to meet our customers' requirements, raw material and energy consumption rates, product quality, capital costs, maintenance requirements and reliability. most of the technology licensed from third-party providers is perpetual and has been paid in full. we own an intellectual property portfolio developed from focused research in both process and product technology. after acquiring or developing a technology, we devote considerable effort to effectively employ the technology and further its development, with a focus towards continuous improvement of our competitive positions.conversely, we have selectively granted licenses to our patented energx® technology for lldpe production and for proprietary ldpe reactor mixing technology. we have also granted several licenses for edc/vcm technology, including the direct chlorination process and catalyst, and s-pvc (suspension pvc for thermoplastic process) process and technology.available information our website address is www.westlake.com. our website content

petrochemical industry has in the past, and may in the future, result in reduced operating margins or operating losses.our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the petrochemical industry. the industry is mature and capital intensive. margins in this industry are sensitive to supply and demand balances both domestically and internationally, which historically have been cyclical. the cycles are generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by periods of oversupply primarily resulting from excess new capacity additions, leading to reduced operating rates and lower margins.9table of contentsmoreover, profitability in the petrochemical industry is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with vigorous price competition which may intensify due to, among other things, new industry capacity. in general, weak economic conditions reduce demand and put pressure on margins. it is not possible to predict accurately the supply and demand balances, market conditions and other factors that will affect industry operating margins in the future.new capacity additions, principally of olefins in north america, asia and the middle east, a number of which have been recently completed, may lead to periods of over-supply and lower profitability. as a result, our olefins segment operating margins may be negatively impacted.we sell commodity products in highly competitive markets and face significant competition and price pressure.we sell our products in highly competitive markets. due to the commodity nature of many of our products, competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on performance, product quality, product deliverability and customer service. as a result, we generally are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers. accordingly, increases in raw material and other costs may not necessarily correlate with changes in prices for these products, either in the direction of the price change or in magnitude. specifically, timing differences in pricing between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated monthly or less often, sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability. significant volatility in raw material costs tends to place pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers could seek relief in the form of lower sales prices.volatility in costs of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.significant variations in the costs and availability of raw materials and energy may negatively affect our results of operations. these costs have risen significantly in the past due primarily to oil and natural gas cost increases. we purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt to produce several basic chemicals. we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. the cost of these raw materials and energy, in the aggregate, represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. the prices of raw materials and energy generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas, which are highly volatile and cyclical. changes to regulatory policies applicable to the german energy sector for industrial users have contributed to higher prices for industrial users of energy in the past and may continue to do so in the future. our results of operations have been and could in the future be significantly affected by increases in these costs.price increases increase our working capital needs and, accordingly, can adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows. in addition, because we utilize the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method of inventory accounting, during periods of falling raw material prices and declining sales prices, our results of operations for a particular reporting period could be negatively impacted as the lower sales prices would be reflected in operating income more quickly than the corresponding drop in feedstock costs. we use derivative instruments in an attempt to reduce price volatility risk on some feedstock commodities. in the future, we may decide not to hedge any of our raw material costs or any hedges we enter into may not have successful results. also, our hedging activities involve credit risk associated with our hedging counterparties, and a deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our hedging counterparties and their abilities to fulfill their obligations to us.lower prices of crude oil, such as those experienced from the third quarter of 2014 through 2019 (at december 31, 2019, approximately 43% lower than their 2014 peak levels), led to a reduction in the cost advantage for natural gas liquids-based ethylene crackers in north america, such as ours, as compared to naphtha-based ethylene crackers. as a result, our margins and cash flows were negatively impacted. lower crude oil and natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in hydraulic fracturing in the united states, which could reduce the availability of feedstock and increase prices of feedstock for our operations. higher natural gas prices could also adversely affect our ability to export products that we produce in the united states outside of the united states. in addition to the impact that this has on our exports from the united states, reduced competitiveness of u.s. producers also has in the past increased the availability of chemicals in north america, as u.s. production that would otherwise have been sold overseas was instead offered for sale domestically, resulting in excess supply and lower prices in north america. we could also face the threat of imported products from countries that have a cost advantage. additionally, the export of natural gas liquids from the united states or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials in the united states, thereby increasing our costs.10table of contentsexternal factors beyond our control can cause fluctuations in demand for our products and in our prices and margins, which may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.external factors beyond our control can cause volatility in raw material prices, demand for our products, product prices and volumes and deterioration in operating margins. these factors can also magnify the impact of economic cycles on our business and results of operations. examples of external factors include:•general economic conditions, including in the united states, europe and asia;•new capacity additions in north america, europe, asia and the middle east;•the level of business activity in the industries that use our products;•competitor action;•technological innovations;•currency fluctuations;•increases in interest rates;•international events and circumstances;•pandemics and other public health threats;•war, sabotage, terrorism and civil unrest;•governmental regulation, including in the united states, europe and asia;•public attitude towards climate change and safety, health and the environment;•perceptions of our products by potential buyers of our products, as well as the public generally, and related changes in behavior, including with respect to recycling;•severe weather and natural disasters; and•credit worthiness of customers and vendors.a number of our products are highly dependent on durable goods markets, such as housing and construction, which are themselves particularly cyclical. weakness in the u.s. residential housing market and economic weakness in europe could have an adverse effect on demand and margins for our products. if the global economy worsens in general, or the u.s. residential housing market or the european economy worsens in particular, demand for our products and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.we may reduce production at or idle a facility for an extended period of time or exit a business because of high raw material prices, an oversupply of a particular product and/or a lack of demand for that particular product, which makes production uneconomical. temporary outages sometimes last for several quarters or, in certain cases, longer and cause us to incur costs, including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities. factors such as increases in raw material costs or lower demand in the future may cause us to further reduce operating rates, idle facilities or exit uncompetitive businesses.hostilities in the middle east or elsewhere or the occurrence, or threat of occurrence, of terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states, europe and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in demand for our products, which could adversely affect our net sales and margins and limit our future growth prospects. volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas could also result in increased feedstock costs. furthermore, sustained lower prices of crude oil, such as the prices experienced from the third quarter of 2014 through 2019, have led and may lead to lower margins in the united states. in addition, these risks could cause increased instability in the financial and insurance markets and could adversely affect our ability to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate or is otherwise required by our contracts with third parties.11table of contentswe operate internationally and are subject to related risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risk and other risks relating to international operations.we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global basis. these risks include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations, imposition or the threat of trade barriers (which could, among other things, negatively impact our ability to export our products outside of the u.s.), imposition or the threat of tariffs and duties (which could, among other things, lead to lower demand for our products outside of the u.s.), restrictions on the transfer of funds, changes in law and regulatory requirements, involvement in judicial proceedings in unfavorable jurisdictions, economic instability and disruptions, political unrest and epidemics. u.s. foreign trade policies could lead to the imposition of additional trade barriers and tariffs on us in foreign jurisdictions. our operating results could be negatively affected by any of these risks.our inability to compete successfully may reduce our operating profits.the petrochemical industry is highly competitive. historically, there have been a number of mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and joint ventures in the industry. this restructuring activity has resulted in fewer but more competitive producers, many of which are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we do. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and chemical industry joint ventures. competition within the petrochemical industry and in the manufacturing of building products is affected by a variety of factors, including:•product price;•balance of product supply/demand;•material, technology and process innovation;•technical support and customer service;•quality;•reliability of raw material and utility supply;•availability of potential substitute materials; and•product performance.changes in the competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operations. these changes could include:•the emergence of new domestic and international competitors;•the rate of capacity additions by competitors;•changes in customer base due to mergers;•the intensification of price competition in our markets;•the introduction of new or substitute products by competitors; and•the technological innovations of competitors.our production facilities process some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could adversely affect our operating results.we have manufacturing sites in north america, europe and asia. our operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with chemical, plastics and building products manufacturing and the related use, storage, transportation and disposal of feedstocks, products and wastes, including:•pipeline leaks and ruptures;•explosions;•fires;•severe weather and natural disasters;•mechanical failure;•unscheduled downtime;•labor difficulties;•transportation interruptions;12table of contents•transportation accidents involving our products;•remediation complications;•chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases;•other environmental risks;•sabotage;•terrorist attacks; and•political unrest.according to some experts, global climate change could result in heightened hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and other weather and natural disaster hazards worldwide. if this materializes, severe weather and natural disaster hazards could pose an even greater risk for our facilities, particularly those in louisiana.all these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, catastrophic damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. we could become subject to environmental claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. a loss or shutdown over an extended period of operations at any one of our chemical manufacturing facilities would have a material adverse effect on us. we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance that we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices, but we cannot be fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from war risks or terrorist acts. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.we are exposed to significant losses from products liability, personal injury and other claims relating to the products we manufacture. additionally, individuals currently seek, and likely will continue to seek, damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to alleged exposure to chemicals at our facilities or to chemicals otherwise owned, controlled or manufactured by us. we are also subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other matters. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain and expect to continue to maintain insurance for products liability, workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other claims, but the amount and scope of such insurance may not be adequate or available to cover a claim that is successfully asserted against us. in addition, such insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.we rely on a limited number of outside suppliers for specified feedstocks and services.we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from a few key suppliers. if any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under any present or future supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials. any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. a vendor may choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship due to general economic concerns or concerns relating to the vendor or us, at any time. any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers, or any significant additional requirements from our suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or with letters of credits, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.13table of contentswe rely heavily on third party transportation, which subjects us to risks and costs that we cannot control. such risks and costs may materially adversely affect our operations.we rely heavily on railroads, barges, pipelines, ships, trucks and other shipping companies to transport raw materials to the manufacturing facilities used by our businesses and to ship finished products to customers. these transport operations are subject to various hazards and risks, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages and operating hazards (including pipeline leaks and ruptures and storage tank leaks), as well as interstate transportation regulations. in addition, the methods of transportation we utilize, including shipping chlorine and other chemicals by railroad, may be subject to additional, more stringent and more costly regulations in the future. if we are delayed or unable to ship finished products or unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any such new regulations or public policy changes related to transportation safety, or these transportation companies fail to operate properly, or if there were significant changes in the cost of these services due to new or additional regulations, or otherwise, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship goods, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.we may pursue acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures and/or other transactions that may impact our results of operations and financial condition.we seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and create stockholder value through various transactions. these transactions may include domestic and international business combinations, purchases or sales of assets or contractual arrangements or joint ventures that are intended to result in the realization of synergies, the creation of efficiencies or the generation of cash to reduce debt. in this regard, we regularly consider acquisition opportunities that would be consistent or complementary to our existing business strategies. to the extent permitted under our credit facility, the indenture governing our senior notes and other debt agreements, some of these transactions may be financed by additional borrowings by us. although we would pursue these transactions because we expect them to yield longer-term benefits if the efficiencies and synergies we expect are realized, they could adversely affect our results of operations in the short term because of the costs associated with such transactions and because they may divert management's attention from existing business operations. other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of our businesses, thereby yielding increased short-term liquidity, but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term. these transactions may not yield the business benefits, synergies or financial benefits anticipated by management. integration of other acquired operations can lead to restructuring charges or other costs. we may have difficulties integrating the operations of other acquired businesses.our operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.we use large quantities of hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes and emissions in our manufacturing operations. due to the associated quantities of hazardous substances and wastes, our industry is highly regulated and monitored by various environmental regulatory authorities such as the epa, federal or state analogs in other countries and the european union, which promulgated the industrial emission directive ("ied"). as such, we are subject to extensive international, national, state and local laws, regulations and directives pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety, which govern, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges onto land or waters, the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace, the remediation of contaminated sites, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. some of these laws, regulations and directives are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations. many of these laws, regulations and directives provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or reduce the likelihood or impact of hazardous substance releases, whether permitted or not. for example, all of our petrochemical facilities in the united states and europe may require improvements to comply with certain changes in process safety management requirements.new laws, rules and regulations as well as changes to laws, rules and regulations may also affect us. for example, on april 17, 2012, the epa promulgated maximum achievable control technology ("mact") standards for major sources and generally available control technology ("gact") standards for area sources of pvc production. the rule sets emission limits and work practice standards for total organic air toxics and for three specific air toxics: vinyl chloride, chlorinated di-benzo dioxins and furans ("cd/df") and hydrogen chloride and includes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission standards. while this rule is the subject of legal challenge and epa reconsideration, the rule has not been stayed.in march 2011, the epa proposed amendments to the emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for mercury emissions from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. these proposed amendments would require improvements in work practices to reduce fugitive mercury emissions. we operate a mercury cell production unit at our natrium facility. we cannot predict the timing or content of the final regulation, or its ultimate cost to, or impact on us.14table of contentsour operations produce greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions, which have been the subject of increased scrutiny and regulation. in december 2015, the united states joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, france. the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. the united states signed the paris agreement in april 2016, and the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016. however, in november 2019, the united states submitted formal notification to the united nations that it intends to withdraw from the paris agreement. pursuant to the terms of the paris agreement, the withdrawal will take effect in november 2020. legislation to regulate ghg emissions has also been introduced in the united states congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.various jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws and regulations on ghg emissions, with the general aim of reducing such emissions. the epa currently requires certain industrial facilities to report their ghg emissions, and to obtain permits with stringent control requirements before constructing or modifying new facilities with significant ghg emissions. in the european union, the emissions trading scheme obligates certain emitters to obtain ghg emission allowances to comply with a cap and trade system for ghg emissions. in addition, the european union has committed to reduce domestic ghg emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. as our chemical manufacturing processes result in ghg emissions, these and other ghg laws and regulations could affect our costs of doing business.similarly, the toxic substances control act ("tsca") imposes reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to the production, handling, and use of chemical substances. the tsca reform legislation enacted in june 2016 expanded the epa's authority to review and regulate new and existing chemicals. under the reform legislation, the epa is required to, among other things, undertake rule making within statutory time frames related to: (1) chemical risk evaluation, designation and management; (2) reporting of mercury supply, use and trade; and (3) management of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemical substances ("pbts"). in response to this mandate, the epa issued rules establishing the epa's process and criteria for identifying high priority chemicals for risk evaluation and setting the epa's approach for determining whether these high priority chemicals present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment. in december 2019, the epa designated certain chemical substances as high priority for risk evaluation. we manufacture several of these chemical substances. although we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities and costs at this time, we do not anticipate that the evaluation of these chemical substances will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. in addition, the tsca inventory reset rule required industry reporting of chemicals manufactured or processed in the united states over the past 10 years, from which the epa will determine which substances are active or inactive on the existing inventory. beginning in august 2019, manufacturers and processors are required to notify the epa before reintroducing into commerce a substance currently identified as "inactive" on the tsca inventory. a final mercury reporting rule published in june 2018 requires manufacturers, including manufacturers who intentionally use mercury in a manufacturing process, to report information about their mercury supply, use and trade. the first periodic report under the new mercury reporting rule was due july 1, 2019. the epa will use the information collected to develop an inventory of mercury and mercury-added products as well as mercury-use manufacturing processes. the epa may then recommend actions or promulgate further rules aimed at reducing mercury use. we cannot predict the timing or content of these actions or rules, or their ultimate cost to, or impact on us.under the ied, european union member state governments are expected to adopt rules and implement environmental permitting programs relating to air, water and waste for industrial facilities. in this context, concepts such as the "best available technique" are being explored. future implementation of these concepts may result in technical modifications in our european facilities. in addition, under the environmental liability directive, european union member states can require the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in certain circumstances, under the "polluter pays principle." we are unable to predict the impact these requirements and concepts may have on our future costs of compliance.these rules or future new, amended or proposed laws or rules could increase our costs or reduce our production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. in addition, we cannot accurately predict future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental and safety laws or regulations, and inspection and enforcement policies, as well as resulting higher compliance costs, which might affect the handling, manufacture, use, emission, disposal or remediation of products, other materials or hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities and costs under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these liabilities and costs may be material.15table of contentswe also may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our facilities or to chemicals that we otherwise manufacture, handle or own. although these types of claims have not historically had a material impact on our operations, a significant increase in the success of these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.environmental laws may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of, and responsibility for, cleanup of contamination at our current and former operating facilities, the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, the costs of reducing emissions and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater. the u.s. comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla"), similar state laws and certain european directives impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that generated waste, arranged for disposal of the wastes, transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites. all such potentially responsible parties (or any one of them, including us) may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. in addition, cercla, similar state laws and certain european directives could impose liability for damages to natural resources caused by contamination.although we seek to take preventive action, our operations are inherently subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances that may make us liable to governmental entities or private parties. this may involve contamination associated with our current and former facilities, facilities to which we sent wastes or by-products for treatment or disposal and other contamination. accidental discharges may occur in the future, future action may be taken in connection with past discharges, governmental agencies may assess damages or penalties against us in connection with any past or future contamination, or third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. in addition, we may be liable for existing contamination related to certain of our facilities for which, in some cases, we believe third parties are liable in the event such third parties fail to perform their obligations.capital projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.we have capital expansion plans for our facilities. expansion projects may be subject to delays or cost overruns, including delays or cost overruns resulting from any one or more of the following:•unexpectedly long delivery times for, or shortages of, key equipment, parts or materials;•shortages of skilled labor and other personnel necessary to perform the work;•delays and performance issues;•failures or delays of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;•unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials;•work stoppages and other labor disputes;•unanticipated actual or purported change orders;•disputes with contractors and suppliers;•design and engineering problems;•latent damages or deterioration to equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;•financial or other difficulties of our contractors and suppliers;•sabotage;•terrorist attacks;•interference from adverse weather conditions; and•difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions.significant cost overruns or delays could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, actual capital expenditures could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures.16table of contentsour level of debt could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.as of december 31, 2019, our indebtedness, including the current portion, totaled $3.4 billion, and our debt represented approximately 35% of our total capitalization. our annual interest expense for 2019 was $124 million, net of interest capitalized of $9 million. our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our existing or future debt agreements could have significant consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt and will not be available for other purposes;•we may not be able to obtain necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes;•our less leveraged competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have greater flexibility to utilize their cash flows to improve their operations;•we may be exposed to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which would result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates;•we could be vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business that would leave us less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions; and•should we pursue additional expansions of existing assets or acquisition of third party assets, we may not be able to obtain additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates.these factors could be magnified or accelerated to the extent we were to finance future acquisitions with significant amounts of debt.to service our indebtedness and fund our capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and pay cash dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, including any distributions that we may receive from westlake partners. this is subject to general economic, financial, currency, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, we may not receive sufficient distributions from westlake partners, and currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule. we also generate revenues denominated in currencies other than that of our indebtedness and may have difficulty converting those revenues into the currency of our indebtedness. we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. in addition, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our credit facility and our senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. all of these factors could be magnified if we were to finance any future acquisitions with significant amounts of debt. the credit agreement and the indenture governing certain of our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions.the credit agreement and the indenture governing certain of our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability to:•pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;•make investments and other restricted payments;•incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;•create liens;•permit dividend or other payment restrictions on our restricted subsidiaries;•sell all or substantially all of our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;•engage in transactions with affiliates; and•engage in sale-leaseback transactions.17table of contentsthese limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. currently, many of these restrictions in the indenture governing certain of our senior notes are suspended under the indenture because those notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a quarterly total leverage ratio.these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance future business opportunities or acquisitions. a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related debt. if a default occurred, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. in addition, any acceleration of debt under the credit agreement will constitute a default under some of our other debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes.our participation in joint ventures and similar arrangements exposes us to a number of risks, including risks of shared control.we are party to several joint ventures and similar arrangements, including an investment, together with lotte chemical usa corporation ("lotte"), in a joint venture, lacc, llc ("lacc"), to build and operate an ethylene facility. our participation in joint ventures and similar arrangements, by their nature, requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. in particular, with respect to our investment in lacc, we are a 46.8% holder and, therefore, our partner lotte has primary control over operations and was primarily responsible for the management of the contractors during construction of the ethylene facility. if there are differences in views among joint venture participants in how to operate a joint venture that result in delayed decisions or the failure to make decisions, or our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan and fulfill its obligations. in that case, we may be required to write down the value of our investment in a joint venture, increase the level of financial or other commitments to the joint venture or, if we have contractual agreements with the joint venture, our operations may be materially adversely affected. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.regulations concerning the transportation of hazardous chemicals and the security of chemical manufacturing facilities could result in higher operating costs.targets such as chemical manufacturing facilities may be at greater risk of terrorist attacks than other targets. as a result, the chemical industry responded to the issues surrounding the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 by implementing initiatives relating to the security of chemicals industry facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals. simultaneously, local, state, national and international governments put into effect a regulatory process that led to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals. our business or our customers' businesses could be adversely affected because of the cost of complying with these regulations.a change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. a material change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.we may have difficulties integrating the operations of future acquired businesses.if we are unable to integrate or to successfully manage businesses that we may acquire in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, cost savings or other benefits expected from acquisitions for a number of reasons, including the following:•we may fail to integrate the businesses we acquire into a cohesive, efficient enterprise;•our resources, including management resources, are limited and may be strained if we engage in a large acquisition or significant number of acquisitions, and acquisitions may divert our management's attention from initiating or carrying out programs to save costs or enhance revenues; and•our failure to retain key employees and contracts of the businesses we acquire.future acquisitions could lead to significant restructuring or other changes.18table of contentsregulations related to "conflict minerals" could adversely impact our business.the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 ("dodd-frank act") contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries (collectively, the "covered countries"). the term "conflict minerals" encompasses tantalum, tin, tungsten (and their ores) and gold.in august 2012, pursuant to the dodd-frank act, the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements applicable to any company that files periodic public reports with the sec, if any conflicts minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that company. these annual reporting requirements require companies to describe reasonable country of origin inquiries, due diligence measures and the results of those activities and related determinations.because we have a highly complex, multi-layered supply chain, we may incur significant costs to comply with these requirements. in addition, the implementation of procedures to comply with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials, including components, used in our products. our suppliers (or suppliers to our suppliers) may not be able or willing to provide all requested information or to take other steps necessary to ensure that no conflict minerals financing or benefiting armed groups are included in materials or components supplied to us for our manufacturing purposes. also, we may encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased by them to be certified as conflict free. if we are not able to meet customer certification requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier. in addition, since the applicability of the new conflict minerals requirements is limited to companies that file periodic reports with the sec, not all of our competitors will need to comply with these requirements unless they are imposed by customers. as a result, those competitors may have cost and other advantages over us.our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations.the vast majority of our employees in europe and asia, and some of our employees in north america, are represented by labor unions and works councils. our operations may be adversely affected by strikes, work stoppages and other labor disputes.we have certain material pension and other post-retirement employment benefit ("opeb") obligations. future funding obligations related to these obligations could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements or require us to borrow additional funds.we have u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans covering certain current and former employees. certain non-u.s. defined benefit plans associated with our european operations have not been funded and we are not obligated to fund those plans under applicable law. as of december 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligations for our pension and opeb plans were $847 million and $69 million, respectively. the fair value of pension investment assets was $545 million as of december 31, 2019. the total underfunded status of the pension obligations calculated on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december 31, 2019 was $302 million, including the westlake defined benefit plan, which was underfunded by $148 million on an individual plan basis.the unfunded opeb obligations as of december 31, 2019 were $69 million. we will require future operating cash flows to fund our pension and opeb obligations, which could restrict available cash for our operations, capital expenditures and other requirements. we may also not generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations, which could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.19table of contentsif our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant.under gaap, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. other intangible assets are reviewed if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. the process of impairment testing for our goodwill and intangible assets involves a number of judgments and estimates made by management including the fair values of assets and liabilities, future cash flows, our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions, overall economic conditions and our strategic operational plans with regards to our business units. if the judgments and estimates used in our analysis are not realized or change due to external factors, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments and estimates, and our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. if our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which could be significant and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security due to internal or external factors including cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products or cause standard business processes to become ineffective, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of information or damage to our reputation. while we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and disaster recovery and incident response plans, our employees, systems, networks, products, facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-assault, and, as such, there can be no assurance that a system failure, network disruption or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our consolidated financial results.we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net sales, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in various currencies might occur in one or many of such currencies over time. from time to time, we may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, including, in particular, the euro and the canadian dollar, could nevertheless materially adversely affect our financial results.in addition, we are exposed to volatility in interest rates. when appropriate, we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. however, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations.20table of contentsour property insurance has only partial coverage for acts of terrorism and, in the event of terrorist attack, we could lose net sales and our facilities.as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 and other events, our insurance carriers created certain exclusions for losses from terrorism from our property insurance policies. while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available, premiums for full coverage are very expensive, especially for chemical facilities, and the policies are subject to high deductibles. available terrorism coverage typically excludes coverage for losses from acts of war and from acts of foreign governments as well as nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. we have determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain full terrorism insurance, especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such insurance. where feasible we have secured some limited terrorism insurance coverage on our property where insurers have included it in their overall programs. in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our facilities, we could lose the net sales from the facilities and the facilities themselves, and could become liable for any contamination or for personal or property damage due to exposure to hazardous materials caused by any catastrophic release that may result from a terrorist attack.westlake partners' tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation. we depend in part on distributions from westlake partners to generate cash for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and other uses. if the internal revenue service ("irs") were to treat westlake partners as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or if westlake partners became subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, its cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced, which would also likely cause a substantial reduction in the value of its common units that we hold.the anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units of westlake partners depends largely on westlake partners being treated as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. despite the fact that westlake partners is organized as a limited partnership under delaware law, it would be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes unless it satisfies a "qualifying income" requirement (the "qualifying income exception") under section 7704 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). failure to meet the qualifying income exception would cause westlake partners to be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes.prior to its initial public offering, westlake partners requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, income from the production, transportation, storage and marketing of ethylene and its co-products constitutes "qualifying income" within the meaning of section 7704 of the code. however, no ruling has been or will be required regarding westlake partners' treatment as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. failure to meet the qualifying income exception or a change in current law could cause westlake partners to be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject westlake partners to taxation as an entity.we will be controlled by our principal stockholder and its affiliates as long as they own a majority of our common stock, and our other stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting during that time. our interests may conflict with those of the principal stockholder and its affiliates, and we may not be able to resolve these conflicts on terms possible in arms-length transactions.as long as ttwf lp (the "principal stockholder") and its affiliates (the "principal stockholder affiliates") own a majority of our outstanding common stock, they will be able to exert significant control over us, and our other stockholders, by themselves, will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote. as a result, the principal stockholder, subject to any fiduciary duty owed to our minority stockholders under delaware law, will be able to control all matters affecting us (some of which may present conflicts of interest), including:•the composition of our board of directors and, through the board, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and the determination of compensation;•any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets;•our financing decisions, capital raising activities and the payment of dividends; and•amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws.the principal stockholder will be permitted to transfer a controlling interest in us without being required to offer our other stockholders the ability to participate or realize a premium for their shares of common stock. a sale of a controlling interest to a third party may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our business and results of operations because the change in control may result in a change of management decisions and business policy. because we have elected not to be subject to section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, the principal stockholder may find it easier to sell its controlling interest to a third party than if we had not so elected.21table of contentsin addition to any conflicts of interest that arise in the foregoing areas, our interests may conflict with those of the principal stockholder affiliates in a number of other areas, including:•business opportunities that may be presented to the principal stockholder affiliates and to our officers and directors associated with the principal stockholder affiliates, and competition between the principal stockholder affiliates and us within the same lines of business;•the solicitation and hiring of employees from each other; and•agreements with the principal stockholder affiliates relating to corporate services that may be material to our business.we may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with the principal stockholder affiliates, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party, particularly if the conflicts are resolved while we are controlled by the principal stockholder affiliates. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the principal stockholder affiliates have no duty to refrain from engaging in activities or lines of business similar to ours and that the principal stockholder affiliates will not be liable to us or our stockholders for failing to present specified corporate opportunities to us. item 1b. unresolved staff commentsnone.item 2. propertiesinformation concerning the principal locations from which our products are manufactured are included in the

equals current assets less current liabilities.(3)ebitda (a non-gaap financial measure) is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. the body of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is commonly referred to as "gaap." for this purpose, a non-gaap financial measure is generally defined by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that (1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or (2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. in this report, we disclose non-gaap financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"). the non-gaap financial measures described in this form 10-k are not substitutes for the gaap measures of earnings and cash flows. ebitda is included in this form 10-k because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present ebitda when reporting their results. we regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using ebitda. in addition, we utilize ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets. management also believes that ebitda is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and ebitda is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. ebitda is not a substitute for the gaap measures of net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating activities and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. in addition, it should be noted that companies calculate ebitda differently and, therefore, ebitda as presented for us may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies. ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization and income taxes. the following table reconciles ebitda to net income, income from operations and net cash

results of operationsoverviewwe are a vertically-integrated global manufacturer and marketer of chemicals, polymers and building products. our two principal operating segments are olefins and vinyls. we use the majority of our internally-produced basic chemicals to produce higher value-added chemicals and building products.consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in 1986. our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added chemical products used in many end-markets. petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed. the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions. ethane-based ethylene producers have in the recent past experienced a cost advantage over naphtha-based ethylene producers during periods of higher crude oil prices. this cost advantage has resulted in a strong export market for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives and has benefited operating margins and cash flows for our olefins segment during such periods. however, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by north american ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices from the third quarter of 2014 through 2019, which has resulted in reduced prices and lower margins for our olefins segment. further, our olefins segment has experienced lower profitability in recent periods due to several new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in north america and asia that have led to additional supply of ethylene and polyethylene. in recent months, we have seen volatility in ethane and ethylene prices, primarily due to changes in the anticipated timing for some of the new ethylene capacity additions and availability of natural gas liquids, as well as fluctuation in the price of crude oil. looking forward, new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in north america, asia and the middle east will add additional supply and may continue to contribute to periods of lower profitability in our olefins segment. since late 2010, the pvc industry in the u.s. has experienced an increase in pvc resin exports, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in the u.s. as a consequence, the u.s. pvc resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010. westlake is the second-largest chlor-alkali producer and the second-largest pvc producer in the world. globally, there were large chlor-alkali capacity additions between 2008 and 2015 resulting in excess capacity and lower industry operating rates which exerted downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. from 2015 through the end of 2018, the capacity additions have been outpaced by an increase in demand driven by improving economic growth and u.s. producers' competitive export position, which resulted in improved operating rates and caustic soda pricing. since the end of 2018, the uncertainties surrounding international trade have impacted both domestic and export prices for our products. depending on the performance of the global economy, potential changes in international trade and tariffs policies, the trend of crude oil prices and the timing of the new ethylene capacity additions in 2020 and beyond, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively or positively impacted.we purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains. we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past, and which may do so in the future include: •the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling;•supply and demand for crude oil;•shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand;•ethane and liquefied natural gas exports;•capacity constraints due to higher construction costs for investments, construction delays, strike action or involuntary shutdowns;•the general level of business and economic activity; and•the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.30table of contentssignificant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices. we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs. normally, there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived. when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms, we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship. our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity, our efficient use of that capacity and our ability to increase capacity. since our inception, we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions, new plant construction and internal expansion. we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs. we also regularly look at acquisition opportunities that would be consistent with, or complimentary to, our overall business strategies. depending on the size of the acquisition, any such acquisitions could require external financing.as noted above in item 1a, "risk factors," we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. further, concerns about ghg emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. while we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.non-gaap financial measuresthe body of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is commonly referred to as "gaap." for this purpose, a non-gaap financial measure is generally defined by the sec as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that (1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or (2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. in this report, we disclose non-gaap financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"). we define ebitda as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. the non-gaap financial measures described in this form 10-k are not substitutes for the gaap measures of earnings and cash flows. ebitda is included in this form 10-k

income attributable to westlake chemical corporation was $421 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,118 million. this represents a decrease in net income attributable to westlake chemical corporation of $575 million, or $4.37 per diluted share, compared to 2018 net income attributable to westlake chemical corporation of $996 million, or $7.62 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,635 million. net income for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased versus the prior year primarily due to lower sales prices for our major products resulting from international trade uncertainties and slower global economic growth, partially offset by lower purchased ethylene, feedstock and fuel costs and a lower effective income tax rate. net sales for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased $517 million to $8,118 million compared to net sales for the year ended december 31, 2018 of $8,635 million, mainly due to lower sales prices for our major products and lower sales volumes for pvc resin, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes for polyethylene, styrene and pvc compounds. income from operations was $656 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to $1,408 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, a decrease of $752 million. the decrease in income from operations versus the prior year was primarily due to lower sales prices for our major products, partially offset by lower purchased ethylene, ethane and fuel costs. pre-tax restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs for the year ended december 31, 2019 were $37 million, or $0.23 per diluted share after tax, as compared to $33 million in 2018.2019 compared with 2018net sales. net sales decreased by $517 million, or 6%, to $8,118 million in 2019 from $8,635

compounds. average sales prices for 2019 decreased by 11% as compared to 2018. sales volumes increased by 5% in 2019 as compared to 2018. gross profit. gross profit margin percentage decreased to 16% in 2019 from 23% in 2018. the gross profit margin decreased primarily due to lower sales prices for our major products (resulting in lower margins), partially offset by lower ethane feedstock, purchased ethylene and fuel costs, as compared to 2018.selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13 million to $458 million in 2019 from $445 million in 2018. this increase was mainly due to selling, general and administrative expenses related to the acquisition of nakan, partially offset by lower professional consulting fees.amortization of intangibles. amortization expense for 2019 was $109 million, as compared to $101 million for 2018. the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to intangible assets related to the acquisition of nakan.restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs. restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs of $37 million in 2019 were higher as compared to $33 million in 2018. the restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs for 2019 primarily consisted of restructuring expenses of $26 million and acquisition costs. the restructuring

integration-related consulting fees and acquisition costs.interest expense. interest expense decreased by $2 million to $124 million in 2019 from $126 million in 2018, primarily as a result of a lower average interest rate for the outstanding debt in 2019 as compared to 2018. the lower average interest rate was primarily due to the redemption of the 4.875% 2023 notes and the 4.625% 2021 notes in 2018 and the issuance of the 1.625% 2029 senior notes in july 2019. see "liquidity and capital resources—debt" below and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for further discussion of our indebtedness.other income, net. other income, net decreased by $14 million to $38 million in 2019 from $52 million in 2018. this decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million in 2018.income taxes. the effective income tax expense rate was 19% in 2019 as compared to 22% in 2018. the effective income tax rate in 2019 was lower as compared to 2018 and lower compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the reduction of a valuation allowance recorded against foreign nol and credit carryforwards and the reduction in accrual of withholding tax on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by an increase in state tax expense. olefins segmentnet sales. net sales decreased by $237 million, or 12%, to $1,782 million in 2019 from $2,019 million in 2018. the decrease was mainly due to lower sales prices for our major products, partially offset by higher polyethylene and styrene sales volumes, as compared to 2018. average sales prices for the olefins segment decreased by 21% in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to increased olefins production from new industry capacity. sales volumes for the olefins segment increased by 9% in 2019, as compared to 2018. 34table of contentsincome from operations. income from operations decreased by $313 million to $260 million in 2019 from $573 million in 2018. the decrease in income from operations was primarily due to the lower sales prices for our major products, partially offset by higher sales volumes for our major products and lower feedstock and fuel costs. trading activity in 2019 resulted in a loss of approximately $26 million as compared to a gain of $3 million in 2018.vinyls segmentnet sales. net sales decreased by $280 million, or 4%, to $6,336 million in 2019 from $6,616 million in 2018. average sales prices for the vinyls segment decreased by 8% in 2019, as compared to 2018, mainly due to lower sales prices for

operations. income from operations decreased by $462 million to $451 million in 2019 from $913 million in 2018. this decrease in income from operations was primarily due to lower caustic soda and pvc resin sales prices, partially offset by lower purchased ethylene, ethane feedstock and fuel costs.2018 compared with 2017net sales. net sales increased by $594 million, or 7%, to $8,635 million in 2018 from $8,041 million in 2017, primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for pvc resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. average sales prices for 2018 increased by 5% as compared to 2017. sales volumes increased by 3% in 2018 as compared to 2017.gross profit. gross profit margin percentage increased to 23% in 2018 from 22% in 2017. the gross profit margin for 2018 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs and improved operating rates in the vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to 2017.selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $46 million, or 12%, to $445 million in 2018 from $399 million in 2017. this increase

and integration-related costs. restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs were $33 million in 2018 as compared to $29 million in 2017. the restructuring, transaction and integration-related costs primarily consisted of integration-related consulting fees, severance benefits provided in conjunction with acquisition and reorganization charges.interest expense. interest expense decreased by $33 million to $126 million in 2018 from $159 million in 2017, primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. the lower average debt balance in 2018 was mainly due to the redemption of the 2023 notes in may 2018 and the 2021 notes in february 2018. see "liquidity and capital resources—debt" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.other income, net. other income, net increased by $37 million to $52 million in 2018 from $15 million in 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, an increase in interest income of $13 million, a net gain of $6 million recognized on the redemption of the 2021 notes and an increase in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $6 million.income taxes. the effective income tax rate was an expense of 22% in 2018 as compared to a benefit of 24% in 2017. the effective tax rate in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017, primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. in addition, the u.s. corporate income tax rate was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. the effective income tax rate in 2018 was above the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state and foreign taxes.olefins segmentnet sales. net sales decreased by $32 million, or 2%, to $2,019 million in 2018 from $2,051 million in 2017. this decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes for styrene as a result of a planned turnaround in the second quarter of 2018 and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene and higher sales prices for styrene, as compared to 2017. average sales prices for the olefins segment decreased by 1% in 2018 as compared to 2017, while average sales volumes in 2018 were consistent with 2017.35table of contentsincome from operations. income from operations was

compared to 2017.cash flowsoperating activitiesoperating activities provided cash of $1,301 million in 2019 compared to cash provided of $1,409 million in 2018. the $108 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to the decrease in income from operations in 2019, as compared to 2018, partially offset by a decrease in working capital requirements. income from operations decreased by $752 million in 2019, as compared to 2018. the decrease in income from operations was primarily a result of lower sales prices for our major products and other factors as discussed in "summary" above. changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, provided cash of $68 million in 2019, compared to $290 million of cash used in 2018, a favorable change of $358 million. the favorable change was driven mainly by changes in accounts receivable and inventories. favorable changes in accounts receivables and inventories were primarily the result of lower sales prices for our products and lower feedstock costs in 2019, as compared to 2018.operating activities provided cash of $1,409 million in 2018 compared to cash provided of $1,528 million in 2017. the $119 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by an increase in income from operations in 2018 and lower income taxes for 2018 as a result of the tax act, as compared to 2017. income from operations increased by $183 million in 2018, as compared to the prior year 2017. the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of higher sales price and volume for caustic soda, partially offset by higher feedstock costs. changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $290 million in 2018, compared to $155 million of cash provided in 2017, an unfavorable change of $445 million. the change was mainly driven by unfavorable changes in inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. unfavorable changes in inventories were primarily the result of higher feedstock costs in 2018 compared to 2017, and the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the timing of purchases and payments to suppliers as well as due to a lower income tax accrual as a result of the lower tax rate under the tax act.investing activitiesnet cash used for investing activities during 2019 was $1,954 million as compared to net cash used of $754 million in 2018. capital expenditures were $787 million in 2019 compared to $702 million in 2018. higher investing activities in 2019 were primarily due to acquisitions for $314 million, net of cash acquired, the purchase of the additional 34.8% interest in lacc for $817 million in november 2019 and payment of $45 million to fund the construction costs of lacc. capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to expansion projects as well as projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. the expansion projects include our previously announced expansions of pvc and vcm capacities at our plants in germany and geismar, louisiana. please see "liquidity and capital resources—liquidity and financing arrangements" below for further discussion. 36table of contentsnet cash used for investing activities during 2018 was $754 million as compared to net cash used of

our calvert city site. the remaining capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. we spent $58 million in 2018 to fund the construction costs of our lacc joint venture, as compared to $66 million in 2017. in addition, we invested $10 million in other unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. please see "liquidity and capital resources—liquidity and financing arrangements" below for further discussion.financing activitiesnet cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was $630 million as compared to net cash used of $1,427 million in 2018. in 2019, we received proceeds of $784 million from the issuance of the 1.625% 2029 senior notes and $63 million from the issuance of westlake partners common units. the remaining activities in 2019 were primarily related to the $132 million payment of cash dividends, the $50 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchases of common stock of $30 million, repayment of notes payable of $18 million and proceeds of $20 million from the issuance of short-term notes

from the issuance of short-term notes payable. the 2017 activity was mainly related to the issuance of notes, drawdown under the credit agreement and issuance of westlake partners common units, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the credit agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and the payment of debt issuance costs.liquidity and capital resourcesliquidity and financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the credit agreement and our long-term financing.in november 2014, our board of directors authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program (the "2014 program"). in november 2015, our board of directors approved the expansion of the 2014 program by an additional $150 million. in august 2018, our board of directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 program by an additional $150 million. as of december 31, 2019, we had repurchased 6,080,191 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $365 million under the 2014 program. during the year ended december 31, 2019, 517,712 shares of our common stock were repurchased under the 2014 program. purchases under the 2014 program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. the 2014 program may be discontinued by our board of directors at any time.on january 2, 2019, we acquired nakan and paid approximately $249 million as the purchase price.on july 17, 2019, we closed the public offering of €700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% 2029 senior notes.37table of contentsin 2015, eagle, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, and lotte formed a joint venture, lacc, to design, build and operate an ethylene facility with 2.2 billion pounds per year of ethylene production capacity. pursuant to a contribution and subscription agreement between eagle and lacc, eagle contributed $225 million to lacc to fund construction costs of the ethylene plant, representing approximately 12% of the membership interests in lacc. as discussed above under "recent developments," in november 2019, eagle acquired an additional 34.8% of the membership interests in lacc from lotte for approximately $817 million. we funded the purchase price for the transaction with cash on hand.we believe that our sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. funding of any potential large expansions or potential acquisitions would likely necessitate, and therefore depend on our ability to obtain, additional financing in the future. we may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets.cash and cash equivalentsas of december 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $728 million. in addition, we have the credit agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under "debt" below.debtas of december 31, 2019, our indebtedness totaled $3,445 million. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. defined terms used in this section have the definitions assigned to such terms in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k. our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the credit agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.credit agreementon july 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on july 24, 2023 (the "credit agreement") and, in connection therewith, terminated the existing $1 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on august 23, 2021 (the "prior credit

and had borrowing availability of $1 billion under the credit agreement. the credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. the credit agreement also contains certain events of default and if and for so long as certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, any overdue amounts outstanding under the credit agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the lenders. none of our subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the credit agreement.the credit agreement includes a $150 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. the credit agreement also provides for a discretionary $50 million commitment for swingline loans to be provided on a same-day basis. we may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least $25 million, up to a maximum of $500 million, subject to certain conditions and if certain lenders agree to commit to such an increase. in connection with our entry into the credit agreement and termination of the prior credit agreement on july 24, 2018, all guarantees by our subsidiaries of our payment obligations under the 4.375% 2047 senior notes, the 3.60% 2022 senior notes, the 3.60%

4.375% 2047 senior notes). see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. revenue bondsin december 1997, we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu, louisiana. the public trust issued $11 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. the interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was 1.78% and 1.85%, respectively.1.625% senior notes due 2029in july 2019, we completed the registered public offering of €700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% 2029 senior notes due july 17, 2029. the company received approximately $779 million of net proceeds from the offering. we may optionally redeem the 1.625% 2029 senior notes at any time and from time to time prior to april 17, 2029 (three months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted "make whole" payment. on or after april 17, 2029, we may optionally redeem the 1.625% 2029 senior notes for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. the holders of the 1.625% 2029 senior notes may require us to repurchase the 2029 senior notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a "change of control" and, within 60 days of such change of control, a "below investment grade rating event" (as such terms are defined in the indenture and supplemental indenture governing the 1.625% 2029 senior notes). the indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 3.60% 2026 senior notes, 5.0% 2046 senior notes, 3.60% 2022 senior notes, 4.375% 2047 senior notes and 1.625% 2029 senior notes contain customary events of default and covenants that will restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt covenants. westlake chemical partners lp credit arrangementsour subsidiary, westlake chemical finance corporation, is the lender party to a $600 million revolving credit facility with westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners"), originally entered into on april 29, 2015. the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in april 2021. borrowings under the revolver bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on westlake partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. westlake partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. as of december 31, 2019, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $377 million and bore interest at the libor rate plus 2.0%.our subsidiary, westlake polymers llc, is the administrative agent to a $600 million revolving credit facility with opco. the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in september 2023. as of december 31, 2019, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $23 million and bore interest at the libor rate plus 2.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.we consolidate westlake partners and opco for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. as such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and westlake partners and opco are eliminated upon consolidation.40table of contentscontractual obligations and commercial commitmentsin addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, finance leases, pension benefits funding, post-retirement healthcare benefits, purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter. the amounts do not include deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in

services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including a minimum quantity and price. we are party to various obligations to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various feedstock, utilities, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage, pipeline usage and logistic support, in each case in the ordinary course of our business, as well as various purchase commitments for our capital projects. the amounts shown in the table above reflect our estimates based on the contractual quantities and the prices in effect under contractual agreements as of december 31, 2019.interest payments. interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at december 31, 2019.asset retirement obligations. this includes the estimated costs and

the $11 million tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and (2) other letters of credit totaling $18 million issued primarily to support commercial obligations and obligations under our insurance programs, including workers' compensation claims.uncertain income tax positions. we have recognized a liability for our uncertain income tax positions of approximately $20 million as of december 31, 2019. we do not believe we are likely to pay any material amounts during the year ending december 31, 2020. the ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are therefore excluded from the contractual obligations table above.off-balance sheet arrangementsnone.41table of contentscritical accounting policiescritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.we apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with gaap. our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, accruals for long-term employee benefits, accounts receivable, income taxes and environmental and legal obligations. inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k. we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.long-lived assets. key estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. such estimates could be significantly modified. the carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the united states and world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions.we evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from one to 40 years. depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $713 million, $641 million and $601 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation or amortization charges would be accelerated.we defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit. total costs deferred on turnarounds were $40 million, $79 million and $47 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. amortization in 2019, 2018 and 2017 of previously deferred turnaround costs was $55 million, $39 million and $30 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, deferred turnaround costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $129 million. expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.additional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k.fair value estimates. we develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities and pension plan assets. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. at december 31, 2019, our recorded goodwill was $1,074 million. in addition, we record all pension plan assets and certain marketable securities at fair value. the fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market-based inputs. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.42table of contentsbusiness combinations and intangible assets including goodwill. we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the same period's financial statements, including the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. the application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. we perform our annual impairment assessment for the olefins and vinyls reporting units in october and april, respectively. we may elect to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment analysis is required. the qualitative assessment considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors related to raw materials and labor, current and projected financial performance, changes in management or strategy, and market capitalization. alternatively, we may unconditionally elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in any period. we elected to perform the quantitative assessment for both of our segments' reporting units during 2019. the quantitative analysis compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. the fair values of the reporting units are calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. the discounted cash flow projections are based on a forecast to reflect the cyclicality of the business. the forecast is based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and financial performance of the market. the future cash flows are discounted to present value using an applicable discount rate. the significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of ebitda a willing buyer is likely to pay. even if the fair values of the reporting units decreased by 10% from the fair values determined in the most recent quantitative tests performed during 2019, the carrying values of the reporting units would not have exceeded their fair values. see item 1a, "risk factors—if our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant."the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.long-term employee benefit costs. our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits, are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is our responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties. it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and, if necessary, adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors.accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match, for each employee, that estimated cost to the period worked. to accomplish this, we rely extensively on advice from actuaries, and we make assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded. changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts. one of the more significant assumptions relates to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations. at december 31, 2019, the projected pension benefit obligations for u.s. and non-u.s. plans were calculated using assumed weighted average discount rates of 3.0% and 1.3%, respectively. the discount rates were determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. as a result of the funding relief provided by the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2015, no minimum funding requirements are expected during 2020 for the u.s. pension plans. additional information on the 2020 funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k.43table of contentsthe following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligation of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:  2019  u.s. plans non-u.s. plans       (dollars in millions)projected benefit obligation, end of year $703 $144discount rate increases by 100 basis points (75) (21)discount rate decreases by 100 basis points 93 26a one-percentage point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare trend rates would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.income taxes. we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.environmental and legal obligations. we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings. we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k.asset retirement obligations. we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. initially, the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. the liability is recorded at its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. we have conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of our manufacturing facilities. we also have conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period. recent accounting pronouncementssee note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition.item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskcommodity price riska substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle. we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies. our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable. we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products. based on our open derivative positions on ethane at december 31, 2019, a hypothetical $0.10 increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before income taxes by $11 million. based on our open derivative positions on ethylene (which are related to opco's third party sales), at december 31, 2019, a hypothetical $0.10 decrease in the price of a pound of ethylene would have increased our income before income taxes by $9 million.44table of contentsinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt. at december 31, 2019, we had $3,489 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt. we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced. if interest rates were 1.0% higher at the time of refinancing, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $35 million. also, at december 31, 2019, we had $11 million principal amount of variable rate debt outstanding, which represents the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds. we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt, but we may do so in the future. the average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of $11 million as of december 31, 2019 was 1.78%. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in the interest expense.libor is used as a reference rate for borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which is currently undrawn. libor is set to be phased out at the end of 2021. we are currently reviewing how the libor phase out will affect us, but we do not expect the impact to be material.foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our international operations. however, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates caused by our international operations has not had a material impact on our overall operating results. we may engage in activities to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in certain instances through the use of currency exchange derivative instruments, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps or spot purchases. a forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified currencies at a stated exchange rate on a stated date. a cross-currency swap obligates us to make periodic payments in the local currency and receive periodic payments in our functional currency based on the notional amount of the instrument. in january 2018, we entered into foreign exchange hedging contracts designated as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional value of €220 million designed to reduce the volatility in stockholders' equity from changes in currency exchange rates associated with our net investments in foreign operations. in july 2019, we terminated a portion of the foreign exchange hedging contract with a notional value of €70 million. the notional value of the remaining net investment hedges was €150 million at december 31, 2019. the arrangement is scheduled to mature in 2026. in july 2019, we completed the registered public offering of €700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% senior notes. we designated this euro-denominated debt as a non-derivative net investment hedge of a portion of our net investments in euro functional-currency denominated subsidiaries to offset foreign currency fluctuations.45table of contentsitem 8. financial statements and supplementary dataindex to consolidated financial

reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob") and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.definition and limitations of internal control over financial reportinga company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 48table of contentscompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.critical audit mattersthe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.goodwill impairment assessment for the north america vinyls reporting unit as described in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's vinyls segment goodwill balance was $1,044 million as of december 31, 2019, which includes the goodwill balance associated with the north america vinyls reporting unit. management performs its annual impairment assessment for the vinyls reporting units in april, including the north america vinyls reporting unit. the quantitative analysis compares the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. the fair value of the north america vinyls reporting unit assessed during the april 2019 impairment test was calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. the discounted cash flow projections were based on a nine-year forecast. the forecast was based on prices and spreads projected by third party industry publications, historical results, and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans. significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projection included projected sales volumes based on production capacities. the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate. significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology included the determination of market comparables and the estimated multiples of net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") a willing buyer is likely to pay.the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment for the north america vinyls reporting unit is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of this reporting unit. this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the significant assumptions used in management's discounted cash flow and market value methodologies, including projected sales volumes, discount rate, determination of market comparables and the estimated multiples of ebitda. in addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.49table of contentsaddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the goodwill impairment assessment for the company's reporting units, including controls over measurement of the fair value of the north america vinyls reporting unit. these procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and market value methodologies; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including projected sales volumes, discount rate, determination of market comparables and the estimated multiples of ebitda. when assessing the assumptions related to projected sales volumes, market comparables, and estimated multiples of ebitda, we evaluated whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the company's discounted cash flow and market value methodologies and certain significant assumptions, including the discount rate./s/pricewaterhousecoopers llphouston, texasfebruary 19, 2020we have served as the company's auditor since 1986, which includes periods before the company became subject to

and per share data)1. description of business and significant accounting policiesdescription of businesswestlake chemical corporation (the "company") operates as an integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. these products include some of the most widely used chemicals in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. the company's customers range from large chemical processors and plastics fabricators to small construction contractors, municipalities and supply warehouses primarily throughout north america and europe. the petrochemical industry is subject to price fluctuations and volatile feedstock pricing typical of a commodity-based industry, the effects of which may not be immediately passed along to customers.westlake chemical partners lpin 2014, the company formed westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. westlake partners' assets consist of a limited partner interest in westlake chemical opco lp ("opco"), as well as the general partner interest in opco. opco's assets include two ethylene production facilities at the company's lake charles, louisiana site, one ethylene production facility at the company's calvert city, kentucky site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from mont belvieu, texas to the company's longview, texas site. as of december 31, 2019, the company held a 77.2% limited partner interest in opco and a controlling interest in westlake partners. the operations of westlake partners are consolidated in the company's financial statements.principles of consolidationthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and subsidiaries in which the company directly or indirectly owns more than a 50% voting interest and exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which the company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. investments in majority-owned companies where the company does not exercise control and investments in nonconsolidated affiliates (20%-50% owned companies, joint ventures and partnerships) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. undistributed earnings from joint ventures included in retained earnings were immaterial as of december 31, 2019. all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. certain reclassifications have been made to the prior-year financial statements to conform to the current-year presentation.noncontrolling interests represent the direct equity interests held by investors in the company's consolidated subsidiaries, westlake partners, taiwan chlorine industries, ltd. and suzhou huasu plastics co., ltd. cash and cash equivalentscash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.concentration of credit riskfinancial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentration of risk consist principally of trade receivables from customers engaged in manufacturing polyethylene products, polyvinyl chloride ("pvc") products and pvc pipe products. the company performs periodic credit evaluations of the customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. the company maintains allowances for potential losses.allowance for doubtful accountsthe determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimation of the amount of accounts receivable that the company believes are unlikely to be collected. estimating this amount requires analysis of the financial strength of the company's customers, the use of historical experience, the company's accounts receivable aged trial balance, and specific collectibility analysis. the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly. past due balances over 90 days and high risk accounts as determined by the analysis of financial strength of customers are reviewed individually for collectibility.56table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)inventoriesinventories primarily include product, material and supplies. inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("fifo") or average method. property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. cost includes expenditures for improvements and betterments that extend the useful lives of the assets and interest capitalized on significant capital projects. capitalized interest was $9, $7 and $4 for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. gains and losses on the disposition or retirement of fixed assets are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations when the assets are sold or retired.depreciation is provided by utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:classification yearsbuildings and improvements 40plant and equipment 10-25other 3-15impairment of long-lived assetsthe company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.impairment of goodwill and intangible assetsgoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. the company performed its annual impairment tests for the olefins and vinyls segments' goodwill in october 2019 and april 2019, respectively, and the impairment tests indicated that the recorded goodwill was not impaired. there has been no impairment of the olefins or vinyls segments' goodwill since the goodwill was initially recorded. other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance. see note 8 for more information on the company's annual goodwill impairment tests.57table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)equity method investmentsthe company accounts for investments using the equity method of accounting if the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, an investee. significant influence generally exists if the company has an ownership interest representing between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated initially at cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and the proportionate share of profit or losses and distributions. the company records its share of the profits or losses of the equity investments, net of income taxes, in the consolidated statements of income. the equity method investments are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. when evidence of loss in value has occurred, management compares the estimated fair value of investment to the carrying value of investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and management considers the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment.other assets, netother assets, net include turnaround costs, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, restricted cash, deferred charges and other long-term assets.the company accounts for turnaround costs under the deferral method. turnarounds are the scheduled and required shutdowns of specific operating units in order to perform planned major maintenance activities. the costs related to the significant overhaul and refurbishment activities include maintenance materials, parts and direct labor costs. the costs of the turnaround are deferred when incurred at the time of the turnaround and amortized (within depreciation and amortization) on a straight-line basis until the next planned turnaround, which ranges from three to six years. deferred turnaround costs are presented as a component of other assets, net. the cash outflows related to these costs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.business combinationsthe company records business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. under the acquisition method of accounting, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. changes in the estimated fair values of net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will adjust the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. measurement period adjustments are reflected in the period in which they occur.income taxesthe company utilizes the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.on december 22, 2017, the united states ("u.s.") tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was signed into law. the tax act, among other changes, reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, and also required a one-time deemed repatriation of foreign earnings at specified rates. the company provisionally recognized a $591 income tax benefit in the 2017 consolidated financial statements that was primarily comprised of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by a one-time u.s. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the company's post-1986 foreign earnings. the company did not record any material measurement period adjustment in 2018. the company's accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act was completed in 2018.58table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)in february 2018, the fasb issued an accounting standards update, income statement—reporting comprehensive income, to (1) allow reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax act; and (2) require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. certain tax effects become stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when deferred tax balances originally recorded at the historical income tax rate are adjusted in income from operations based on the lower, newly-enacted income tax rate. the company adopted the accounting standard effective october 1, 2018 and reclassified $13 of stranded tax effects relating to its pension benefits liability and cumulative effect of foreign exchange from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings.as a result of the tax act, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") concluded that global intangible low-taxed income tax ("gilti tax") can be recognized in the financial statements, no later than december 22, 2018, per an accounting policy choice, by: (1) recording a period cost (permanent item) or (2) providing deferred income taxes stemming from certain basis differences that are expected to result in gilti tax. the company elected to record gilti tax as a period cost. the gilti tax recognized in 2019 and 2018 were not material to the consolidated financial statements.foreign currency translationassets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to u.s. dollars at the exchange rate as of the end of the year. statement of operations items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity.revenue recognitionrevenue is recognized when the company transfers control of inventories to its customers. amounts recognized as revenues reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those inventories. provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are incorporated in the estimate of variable consideration and reflected as reduction to revenue in the same period as the related sales.control of inventories generally transfers upon shipment for domestic sales. the company excludes taxes collected on behalf of customers from the estimated contract price. for export contracts, the point at which control passes to the customer varies depending on the terms specified in the customer contract. the company generally invoices customers and recognizes revenue and accounts receivable upon transferring control of inventories. in limited circumstances, the company transfers control of inventories shortly before it has an unconditional right to receive consideration, resulting in recognition of contract assets. the company also receives advance payments from certain customers, resulting in recognition of contract liabilities. contract assets and liabilities are generally settled within the period and are not material to the consolidated balance sheets. the company expenses sales commissions when incurred. these costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. aside from the amounts disclosed within note 9, the company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations because its contracts with customers (1) have an original expected duration of one year or less or (2) have only variable consideration that is calculated based on market prices at specified dates and is allocated to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations.the company adopted asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606"), effective january 1, 2018. the company applied the modified retrospective transition method to all contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. periods prior to january 1, 2018 were not adjusted and are reported under the accounting standards that were in place during those periods. the cumulative effects of changes to the company's consolidated january 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of this accounting standard were immaterial.the impact of asc 606 adoption on the financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared with the guidance that was in effect prior to january 1, 2018 was immaterial.asc 606 requires disclosure of disaggregated revenue into categories that depict the nature of how the company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. the company discloses revenues by product and segment in note 23. prior to the adoption of asc 606, the revenue was recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, products were delivered to the customer, the sales price was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured. for domestic contracts, title and risk of loss had passed to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts. for export contracts, the title and risk of loss had passed to customers at the time specified by each contract. 59table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)transportation and freightamounts billed to customers for freight and handling costs on outbound shipments are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. transportation and freight costs incurred by the company on outbound shipments are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.price risk managementthe company recognizes derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in a derivative's fair value are currently recognized in earnings or comprehensive income, depending on the designation of the derivative. if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in comprehensive income and is recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings currently. the derivative instruments did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.asset retirement obligationsthe company has conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of the company's manufacturing facilities. the company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. recognized asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. the liability is accreted to its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. as of december 31, 2019, the company had $7 and $20 of asset retirement obligations recorded as accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, the company had $8 and $20 of asset retirement obligations recorded as accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively. the company also has conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period. environmental costsenvironmental costs relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on whether such costs provide future economic benefits. remediation liabilities are recognized when the costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. environmental liabilities in connection with properties that are sold or closed are realized upon such sale or closure, to the extent they are probable and estimable and not previously reserved. recognition of any joint and several liabilities is based upon the company's best estimate of its final pro rata share of the liability.use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from those estimates.60table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)recent accounting pronouncementscredit losses (asu no. 2016-13)in june 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an accounting standards update providing new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. the new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on trade receivables, debt securities and certain types of financial instruments. the standard also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. in november 2019, the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance related to credit losses. the accounting standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.intangibles - goodwill and other (asu no. 2017-04)in january 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill. the guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. the accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.fair value measurement (asu no. 2018-13)in august 2018, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. the amendments are effective for periods beginning after december 15, 2019. an entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until the effective date. most amendments should be applied retrospectively, but certain amendments will be applied prospectively. the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the standard on the company's fair value disclosures. however, the standard is not expected to have an impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.income taxes (asu no. 2019-12)in december 2019, the fasb issued an accounting standards update removing certain exceptions for investments, intraperiod allocations and interim calculations and adding guidance to reduce complexity in accounting for income taxes. the accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2020. early adoption of this guidance is permitted. the company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.recently adopted accounting standardsleases (asu no. 2016-02)in february 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update on lease accounting that supersedes the previously issued lease guidance. the new standard requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all long-term operating leases. an asset is recognized for the right to use an underlying leased asset and a liability is recognized for the obligation to make payments over the lease term. the standard also requires expanded lease disclosures. the standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach and allows for the election of certain transition expedients.the company adopted the standard on january 1, 2019 using the optional transition method, which allows entities to recognize a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance sheet in the period of adoption. the company elected the package of optional transition expedients and was not required to reassess (1) whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) classification of existing leases as operating or capital or (3) whether initial direct costs for existing leases qualify for capitalization under the new accounting standard. the company did not elect the use of hindsight to determine the lease term when considering lease renewal or termination options. additionally, the company elected to continue accounting for existing land easements under its accounting policies that were in effect prior to adoption of the new lease standard. the following amounts were recorded as a result of adopting the new lease standard on january 1, 2019:61table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share

company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in the parent entity of the nakantm global compounding solutions business. nakan's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries.the closing purchase price of $249 was paid with available cash on hand. the acquisition is being accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of nakan are included in the vinyls segment.nakan's net sales and earnings since the acquisition date were not material to the company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019. the acquisition-related costs recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 were not material. the pro forma impact of this acquisition has not been presented as it is not material to the company's consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.the following table summarizes the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. the allocation of consideration transferred is based on management's estimates, judgments and assumptions. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management made significant estimates, judgments and assumptions. management estimated that consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. therefore, goodwill of $40 was recorded. the goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the expected value to be achieved from the acquisition. the information below represents the purchase price allocation:62table of contents    westlake chemical

various long-term and short-term operating leases for rail cars, buildings, land and other transportation and storage assets. the company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. some of the company's arrangements contain both lease and non-lease components. for certain transportation equipment leases, the company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. the company records right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities for operating leases with terms greater than one year. operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recorded at the present value of the fixed lease payments over the life of the lease. the majority of the company's leases do not provide an implicit rate. therefore, the company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. certain of the company's leases provide for renewal and purchase options. renewal and purchase options are evaluated at lease commencement and included in the lease term if they are reasonably certain to be exercised. short-term leases are recognized in rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. the company's finance leases are not material to the consolidated financial statements.63table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)lease-related

during the fourth quarter of 2019. the fair value of the olefins segment reporting unit assessed during the october 2019 impairment analysis was determined using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. based upon this assessment, the company determined that the fair value of the olefins segment reporting unit was greater than the carrying value.the discounted cash flow projections were based on a nine-year forecast, from 2020 to 2028, to reflect the cyclicality of the company's olefins business. the forecast was based on prices and spreads projected by ihs markit ("ihs"), a chemical industry organization offering market and business advisory services for the chemical market, historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans. other significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projection included projected sales volumes based on production capacities. the future cash flows were

issued $89 of 6 ½% tax-exempt revenue bonds due november 1, 2035 under the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 (the "go zone act") (the "6 ½% 2035 go zone bonds"). in connection with the issuance of the 6 ½% 2035 go zone bonds, the company issued $89 of the 6 ½% 2035 go zone senior notes. in july 2010, the authority completed the reoffering of $100 of 6 ½% tax-exempt revenue bonds due august 1, 2029 under the go zone act (the "6 ½% 2029 go zone bonds"). in connection with the reoffering of the 6 ½% 2029 go zone bonds, the company issued $100 of the 6 ½% 2029 go zone senior notes.each series of the tax-exempt bonds is subject to redemption and the holders may require the bonds to be repurchased upon a change of control or a change in or loss of the current tax status of the bonds. in addition, the bonds are subject to optional redemption by the authority upon the direction of the company if certain events have occurred in connection with the operation of the projects for which the bond proceeds may be used, including if the company has determined that the continued operation of any material portion of the projects would be impracticable, uneconomical or undesirable for any reason.68table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)in november 2017, the authority completed the remarketing of $250 aggregate principal amount of 3.50% tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds due november 1, 2032 (the "3.50% 2032 go zone bonds"). in connection with the remarketing of the 3.50% 2032 go zone bonds, the company issued $250 of the 3.50% 2032 senior notes. the 3.50% 2032 go zone bonds are subject to optional redemption by the authority upon the direction of the company at any time on or after november 1, 2027, for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. the indenture governing the 3.50% 2032 senior notes contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict the company and certain of the company's subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all of substantially all of its assets.in connection with each offering of the tax-exempt bonds, the company entered into a loan agreement with the authority pursuant to which the company agreed to pay all of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds and certain other amounts to the authority. the net proceeds from the offerings were loaned by the authority to the company. the company used the proceeds to expand, refurbish and maintain certain of its facilities in the louisiana parishes of calcasieu and ascension. the bonds are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. as of december 31, 2019, the company had drawn all proceeds from the tax-exempt bonds. in connection with each such offering of the tax-exempt bonds, the company issued senior notes under a base indenture and supplemental indenture to collateralize its obligations under the loan agreement relating to such tax-exempt bonds (collectively, the "tax-exempt bond related senior notes").the indentures governing the tax-exempt bond related senior notes excluding the 3.5% 2032 go zone refunding senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default. accordingly, these agreements generally impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the company. these restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets. however, the effectiveness of certain of these restrictions is currently suspended because the tax-exempt bond related senior notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the most significant of these provisions, if it were currently effective, would restrict the company from incurring additional debt, except specified permitted debt (including borrowings under its credit facility), when the company's fixed charge coverage ratio is below 2.0:1. these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including, without limitation, an exception for the payment of the company's regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.10 per share. if the restrictions were currently effective, distributions in excess of $100 would not be allowed unless, after giving pro forma effect to the distribution, the company's fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 2.0:1 and such payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january 13, 2006, is less than the sum of 50% of the company's consolidated net income for the period from october 1, 2003 to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed, plus 100% of net cash proceeds received after october 1, 2003 as a contribution to the company's common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities, plus several other adjustments.revenue bondsin december 1997, the company entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu, louisiana. the public trust issued $11 principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance the company's construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. the interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at december 31, 2019 and 2018 was 1.78% and 1.85%, respectively.as of december 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with all of its long-term debt covenants.the weighted average interest rate on all long-term debt was 3.6% and 4.4% at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. unamortized debt issuance costs on long-term debt were $30 and $25 at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. aggregate scheduled maturities of long-term debt during the next five years consist of $250 in 2022. there are no other scheduled maturities of debt in 2020 through 2024. 12. stockholders' equitythe company's board of directors has declared regular quarterly dividends to holders of its common stock aggregating $132, $120 and $103 for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.common stockeach share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters on which holders are permitted to vote, including the election of directors. there are no cumulative voting rights. accordingly, holders of a majority of the total votes entitled to vote in an election of directors will be able to elect all of the directors standing for election. subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, the holders of the common stock will share equally on a per share basis any dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. if the company is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of the company's common stock will be entitled to a ratable share of any distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of all the company's liabilities and of the prior rights of any outstanding class of the company's preferred stock. the company's common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the company's common stock.preferred stockthe company's charter authorizes the issuance of shares of preferred stock. the company's board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred shares from time to time in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and terms of each such series. the board may determine the designations and other terms of each series including dividend rates, whether dividends will be cumulative or non-cumulative, redemption rights, liquidation rights, sinking fund provisions, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights.stock repurchase programin november 2014, the company's board of directors approved a $250 share repurchase program (the "2014 program"). in november 2015, the company's board of directors approved the expansion of the 2014 program by an additional $150. in august 2018, the company's board of directors approved the expansion of the 2014 program by an additional $150. the number of shares repurchased by the company under the 2014 program was 517,712, 1,368,881 and 0 for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. as of december 31, 2019, the company had repurchased a total of 6,080,191 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $365.any shares repurchased under the 2014 program are held by the company as treasury stock and may be used for general corporate purposes, including for the 2013 omnibus incentive plan. in 2014, the company began delivering treasury shares to employees and non-employee directors for options exercised and for the settlement of restricted stock units. the cost of treasury shares delivered is determined using the specific identification method.13. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by

regular full-time and part-time employees, whereby eligible employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their annual eligible compensation, subject to an annual plan limit in line with the annual elective contribution limit as determined by the internal revenue service. the company matches its employee's contribution up to a certain percentage of such employee's compensation, per the terms of the plan. the company may, at its discretion and per the terms of the plan, make an additional non-matching contribution in an amount as the board of directors may determine. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company recorded approximately $20, $21 and $23, respectively, to expense for these contributions. further, within the plan, the company also makes an annual retirement contribution to substantially all employees of certain subsidiaries. the company's contributions to the plan are determined as a percentage of employees' pay. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company charged approximately $32, $31 and $29, respectively, to expense for these contributions.non-u.s. plansthe company has defined contribution plans in several countries covering eligible employees of the company. the company's contributions to the plans are based on applicable laws in each country. contributions to the company's non-u.s. defined contribution plans are made by both the employee and the company. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company charged approximately $4, $5 and $5, respectively, to expense for its contributions to these plans.defined benefit plansu.s. plansthe company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible salaried and wage employees of certain subsidiaries. however, eligibility for the company's plans has been frozen. benefits for salaried employees under these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. benefits for wage employees are based upon years of service and a fixed amount as periodically adjusted. the company recognizes the years of service prior to the company's acquisition of the subsidiary's facilities for purposes of determining vesting, eligibility and benefit levels for certain employees of the subsidiary and for determining vesting and eligibility for certain other employees of the subsidiary. the measurement date for these plans is december 31.non-u.s. plansthe company has defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees associated with the company's operations. these pension plans are closed to new participants. benefits for employees for these plans are based primarily on employees' pay near retirement. these pension plans are unfunded and have no plan assets. the measurement date for the non-u.s. plans is december 31.details of the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the company's pension plans are as

benefits were $0 and $22 for 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reflected in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).in the u.s., the pension protection act of 2006 (the "pension protection act") established a relationship between a qualified pension plan's funded status and the actual benefits that can be provided. restrictions on plan benefits and additional funding and notice requirements are imposed when a plan's funded status is less than certain threshold levels. for the 2019 plan year, the funded status for the company's u.s. pension plans are above 80% and, as such, are exempt from the pension protection act's benefit restrictions. pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at december 31 are as

company's u.s. pension plans settled portions of their projected benefit obligations through the purchase of annuities and lump sum payments to certain participants. in conjunction with the settlement, the company also remeasured the pension obligations and plan assets of the affected plans, resulting in a $26 increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before tax and a corresponding decrease in net pension liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. during 2018, the company recognized a $14 one-time settlement gain in other income, net, which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).72table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars,

non-u.s. plans are determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate for the company. the assumed long-term return on plan assets is estimated by considering factors such as the plan's overall investment strategy, current economic conditions and historical averages.the company's u.s. pension plan investments are held in the westlake defined benefit plan. the company's overall investment strategy for these pension plan assets is to achieve a balance between moderate income generation and capital appreciation. the investment strategy includes a mix of approximately 60% of investments for long-term growth, and 40% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types. these pension funds' investment policies target asset allocations from approximately 60% equity securities and 40% fixed income securities in order to pursue a balance between moderate income generation and capital appreciation.equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies located in the u.s. and international developed and emerging markets stocks. fixed income securities are comprised of investment and non-investment grade bonds, including u.s. treasuries and u.s. and non-u.s. corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries. each pension fund investment policy allows a discretionary range in various asset classes within the asset allocation model of up to 10%. the company does not believe that there are significant concentrations of risk in the pension plan assets due to its strategy of asset diversification. at december 31, 2019, plan assets did not include direct ownership of the company's common stock.under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, inputs used to measure fair value are classified in one of three levels:level 1: quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2: observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.level 3: unobservable inputs that are not corroborated

westlake chemical corporation 2013 omnibus incentive plan (as amended and restated in 2017, the "2013 plan"), all employees and non-employee directors of the company, as well as certain individuals who have agreed to become the company's employees, are eligible for awards. shares of common stock may be issued as authorized in the 2013 plan. at the discretion of the administrator of the 2013 plan, employees and non-employee directors may be granted awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock units or cash awards (any of which may be a performance award). outstanding stock option awards have a 10-year term and vest (1) ratably on an annual basis over a three-year period or (2) at the end of a five-year period. outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units vest either (1) ratably on an annual basis over a two to five-year period or (2) at the end of a three or six-year period. in accordance with accounting guidance related to share-based payments, stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards is based on estimated grant-date fair value. the company recognizes these stock-based compensation costs net of a forfeiture rate and on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award for only those shares expected to vest. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the total recognized stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards issued under the 2013 plan was $24, $18 and $14, respectively.option activity and changes during the year

measurementsthe company has financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. these financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts payable and long-term debt, all of which are recorded at carrying value. the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. the carrying and fair values of the company's long-term debt at december 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the table below. the company's long-term debt instruments are publicly-traded. a market approach, based upon quotes from financial reporting services, is used to measure the fair value of the company's long-term debt. because the company's long-term debt instruments may not be actively traded, the inputs used to measure the fair value of the company's long-term debt are classified as level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.  2019 2018  carryingvalue fairvalue carryingvalue fairvalue3.60% 2022 senior notes $249 $255 $249 $2483.60% 2026 senior notes 742 777 741 692loan

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)at december 31, 2019, the company had federal, foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards ("nols") of approximately $539, $217 and $613, respectively. the increase in the federal and state nols is primarily due to bonus tax depreciation from the company's investment in lacc accounted for as an equity method investment. the federal nol and certain foreign and state nols do not expire, while certain other foreign and state nols expire in varying amounts between 2020 and 2039. certain nols are subject to limitations on an annual basis. at december 31, 2019, the company had various federal, foreign and state credits carryforwards of $2, $4 and $19, respectively, which either do not expire or expire in varying amounts between 2020 and 2033. management believes the company will realize the benefit of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire, but to the extent that the full benefit may not be realized, a valuation allowance has been recorded. the valuation allowance decreased by $17 in 2019, primarily due to a $19 release in valuation allowance resulting from a change in management judgment regarding the realizability of certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss and credit carryforwards, as a result of the change in expectations of income in future years.as result of the tax act, the company recognized an income tax benefit of $591 in the 2017 consolidated financial statements for items such as a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by a one-time u.s. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the company's post-1986 foreign earnings. the company did not record any material measurement period adjustment in 2018. the accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act was completed in 2018.the company files income tax

interests (consisting of 14,122,230 common units) and incentive distribution rights.on october 4, 2018, westlake partners and westlake partners gp, the general partner of westlake partners, entered into an equity distribution agreement with ubs securities llc, barclays capital inc., citigroup global markets inc., deutsche bank securities inc., rbc capital markets, llc, merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated and wells fargo securities, llc to offer and sell westlake partners' common units, from time to time, up to an aggregate offering amount of $50. no common units were issued under this program in 2019 and 2018.22. commitments and contingenciesthe company is involved in a number of legal and regulatory matters, principally environmental in nature, that are incidental to the normal conduct of its business, including lawsuits, investigations and claims. the outcome of these matters are inherently unpredictable. the company believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all known legal and regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements; however, under certain circumstances, if required to recognize costs in a specific period, when combined with other factors, outcomes with respect to such matters may be material to the company's consolidated statements of operations in such period. the company's assessment of the potential impact of environmental matters, in particular, is subject to uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation of such environmental matters, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. in addition, the impact of evolving claims and programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site reuse initiatives and state remediation programs creates further uncertainty of the ultimate resolution of these matters. the company anticipates that the resolution of many legal and regulatory matters, and in particular environmental matters, will occur over an extended period of time.the company and other caustic soda producers were named as defendants in multiple purported class action civil lawsuits filed since march 2019 in the u.s. district court for the western district of new york. the lawsuits allege the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price of caustic soda, restrict domestic (u.s.) supply of caustic soda and allocate caustic soda customers. the other defendants named in the lawsuits are olin corporation, k.a. steel chemicals (a wholly-owned subsidiary of olin), occidental petroleum corporation, occidental chemical corporation d/b/a oxychem, shin-etsu chemical co., ltd., shintech incorporated, formosa plastics corporation, and formosa plastics corporation, u.s.a. each of the lawsuits is filed on behalf of the respective named plaintiff or plaintiffs and a putative class comprised of either direct purchasers or indirect purchasers of caustic soda in the u.s. plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages and injunctive relief. the company has already moved to dismiss the majority of the lawsuits filed and plans to file similar motions with respect to the remaining lawsuits. at this time, the company is not able to estimate the impact, if any, that these lawsuits could have on the company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in future periods.environmental. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling approximately $47 and $54, respectively, most of which was classified as noncurrent liabilities. the company's assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments.85table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)calvert city proceedings. for several years, the environmental protection agency (the "epa") has been conducting remedial investigation and feasibility studies at the company's calvert city, kentucky facility pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 ("cercla"). as the current owner of the calvert city facility, the company was named by the epa as a potentially responsible party ("prp") along with goodrich corporation ("goodrich") and its successor-in-interest, polyone corporation ("polyone"). on november 30, 2017, the epa published a draft proposed plan, incorporating by reference an august 2015 draft remedial investigation ("ri") report, an october 2017 draft feasibility study ("fs") report and a new technical impracticability waiver document dated december 19, 2017. on june 18, 2018, the epa published an amendment to its proposed plan. the amended proposed plan describes a final remedy for the onshore portion of the site comprised of a containment wall, targeted treatment and supplemental hydraulic containment. the amended proposed plan also describes an interim approach to address the contamination under the river that would include recovery of any mobile contaminants by an extraction well along with further study of the extent of the contamination and potential treatment options. the epa's estimated cost of implementation is $107, with an estimated $1 to $3 in annual operation and maintenance ("o&m") costs. in september 2018, the epa published the record of decision ("rod") for the site, formally selecting the preferred final and interim remedies outlined in the amended proposed plan. in october 2018, epa issued special notice letters to the prps for the remedial design phase of work under the rod. in april 2019, the prps and the epa entered into an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent for remedial design. in october 2019, the prps received special notice letters for the remedial action phase of work at the site. the company, jointly with the other prps, submitted a good faith offer response in december 2019. the company's allocation of liability for remedial and o&m costs at the calvert city site, if any, is governed by a series of agreements between the company, goodrich and polyone. these agreements are the subject of further litigation as described below.in connection with the 1990 and 1997 acquisitions of the goodrich chemical manufacturing complex in calvert city, goodrich agreed to indemnify the company for any liabilities related to preexisting contamination at the complex. for its part, the company agreed to indemnify goodrich for post-closing contamination caused by the company's operations. the soil and groundwater at the complex, which does not include the company's nearby pvc facility, had been extensively contaminated by goodrich's operations. in 1993, goodrich spun off the predecessor of polyone, and that predecessor assumed goodrich's indemnification obligations relating to preexisting contamination. in 2003, litigation arose among the company, goodrich and polyone with respect to the allocation of the cost of remediating contamination at the site. the parties settled this litigation in december 2007 and the case was dismissed. in the settlement, the parties agreed that, among other things: (1) polyone would pay 100% of the costs (with specified exceptions), net of recoveries or credits from third parties, incurred with respect to environmental issues at the calvert city site from august 1, 2007 forward; and (2) either the company or polyone might, from time to time in the future (but not more than once every five years), institute an arbitration proceeding to adjust that percentage. in may 2017, polyone filed a demand for arbitration. in this proceeding, polyone sought to readjust the percentage allocation of future costs and to recover approximately $11 from the company in reimbursement of previously paid remediation costs. the company's cross demand for arbitration seeking unreimbursed remediation costs incurred during the relevant period was dismissed from the proceedings when polyone paid such costs in full at the beginning of the arbitration hearing.  on july 10, 2018, polyone sued the company in the u.s. district court for the western district of kentucky and sought to invalidate the arbitration provisions in the parties' 2007 settlement agreement and enjoin the arbitration it had initiated in 2017. on july 30, 2018, the district court refused to enjoin the arbitration and, on january 15, 2019, the court granted the company's motion to dismiss polyone's suit. on february 13, 2019, polyone appealed those decisions to the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit. the court of appeals issued an opinion and final order on september 6, 2019, affirming the district court. the arbitration hearing began in august 2018 and concluded in december 2018. on may 22, 2019, the arbitration panel issued its final award. it determined that polyone was responsible for 100% of the allocable costs at issue in the proceeding and that polyone would remain responsible for 100% of the costs to operate the existing groundwater remedy at the calvert city site. in august 2019, polyone filed a motion to vacate before the u.s. district court for the western district of kentucky, seeking to invalidate the final award under the federal arbitration act. on february 11, 2020, the u.s. district court for the western district of kentucky denied polyone's motion to vacate and affirmed the arbitration final award. polyone has until march 10, 2020 to appeal that order.86table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)at this time, the company is not able to estimate the impact, if any, that the issuance of the final award in the arbitration proceeding, or any subsequent judicial proceeding, could have on the company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in later periods. any cash expenditures that the company might incur in the future with respect to the remediation of contamination at the calvert city complex would likely be spread out over an extended period. as a result, the company believes it is unlikely that any remediation costs allocable to it will be material in terms of expenditures made in any individual reporting period.environmental remediation: reasonably possible matters. the company's assessment of the potential impact of environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, the company may be subject to reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters in the range of $70 to $130.other commitmentsthe company has various unconditional purchase obligations, primarily to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various utilities, feedstock, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage and pipeline usage. unrecorded unconditional purchase obligations for the next five years are as follows: $584, $621, $497, $461 and $360 in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 23. segment and geographic informationsegment informationthe company operates in two principal operating segments: olefins and vinyls. these segments are strategic business units that offer a variety of different products. the company manages each segment separately as each business requires different technology and marketing strategies.the company's olefins segment manufactures and markets polyethylene, styrene monomer and
