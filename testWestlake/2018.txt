statements about forward-looking statementsthe private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides safe harbor provisions for forward-looking information. certain of the statements contained in this form 10-k are forward-looking statements. all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this form 10-k that address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believes," "intends," "may," "should," "could," "anticipates," "expected" or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategies or trends. although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct. forward-looking statements relate to matters such as: •future operating rates, margins, cash flows and demand for our products;•industry market outlook, including the price of crude oil;•production capacities;•currency devaluation;•our ability to borrow additional funds under our credit agreement;•our ability to meet our liquidity needs;•our ability to meet debt obligations under our debt instruments;•our intended quarterly dividends;•future capacity additions and expansions in the industries in which we compete;•results of acquisitions, including our acquisition of nakantm;•timing, funding and results of capital projects, such as the construction of the lacc plant and

related penalties, capital expenditures, remedial actions and proceedings, including any new laws, regulations or treaties that may come into force to limit or control carbon dioxide and other ghg emissions or to address other issues of climate change;•effects of pending legal proceedings; and•timing of and amount of capital expenditures.we have based these statements on assumptions and analyses in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe were appropriate in the circumstances when the statements were made. forward-looking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such statements. while it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties. among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed under "risk factors" and those described from time to time in our other filings with the sec including, but not limited to, the following: •general economic and business conditions;•the cyclical nature of the chemical and building products industries;•the availability, cost and volatility of raw materials and energy;•uncertainties associated with the united states, european and worldwide economies, including those due to political tensions and unrest in the middle east and elsewhere;•current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and other countries and political unrest in other areas;•industry production capacity and operating rates;•the supply/demand balance for our products;itable of contents•competitive products and pricing pressures;•instability in the credit and financial markets;•access to capital markets;•terrorist acts;•operating interruptions (including leaks, explosions, fires, weather-related incidents, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, spills and releases and other environmental risks);•changes in laws or regulations, including trade policies;•technological developments;•foreign currency exchange risks;•our ability to implement our business strategies; and•creditworthiness of our customers.many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. any of the factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels. every forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.industry and market data industry and market data used throughout this form 10-k were obtained through internal company research, surveys and studies conducted by unrelated third parties and publicly available industry and general publications, including information from ihs markit ("ihs"). we have not independently verified market and industry data from external sources. while we believe internal company estimates are reliable and market definitions are appropriate, neither such estimates nor these definitions have been verified by any independent sources. production capacity unless we state otherwise, annual production capacity estimates used throughout this form 10-k represent rated capacity of the facilities at december 31, 2018. we calculated rated capacity by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate, after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance, and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit's optimal daily output based on the design feedstock mix. because the rated capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount, actual production volumes may be more or less than the rated capacity. iitable of contentspart iitem 1. businessgeneralwe are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. our products include some of the most widely used chemicals in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, water treatment, refrigerants, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. we operate in two principal operating segments, olefins and vinyls. we are highly integrated along our olefins product chain with significant downstream integration into polyethylene and styrene monomer. we are also an integrated global producer of vinyls with substantial downstream integration into polyvinyl chloride ("pvc") building products.we began operations in 1986 after our first polyethylene plant, an olefins segment business, near lake charles, louisiana was acquired from occidental petroleum corporation. we began our vinyls operations in 1990 with the acquisition of a vinyl chloride monomer ("vcm") plant in calvert city, kentucky from goodrich corporation. in 1992, we commenced our vinyls segment's building products operations after acquiring three pvc pipe plants. since 1986, we have grown rapidly into an integrated global producer of petrochemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. we achieved this growth by acquiring existing plants or constructing new plants and completing numerous capacity or production line expansions. we regularly consider acquisitions and other internal and external growth opportunities that would be consistent with, or complementary to, our overall business strategy.in 2014, we formed westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. also in 2014, westlake partners completed an initial public offering of 12,937,500 common units (the "westlake partners ipo"). on september 29, 2017, westlake partners completed a secondary offering of 5,175,000 common units at a price of $22.00 per unit and purchased an additional 5.0% newly-issued limited partner interest in westlake chemical opco lp ("opco") for approximately $229 million resulting in an aggregate 18.3% limited partner interest in opco effective july 1, 2017. as of february 13, 2019, westlake partners' assets consist of an 18.3% limited partner interest in opco, as well as the general partner interest in opco. prior to the westlake partners ipo, opco's assets were wholly-owned by us. opco's assets include two ethylene production facilities at our olefins facility at our lake charles site, one ethylene production facility at our calvert city site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from mont belvieu, texas to the longview, texas site, which includes our longview polyethylene production facility. we retain an 81.7% limited partner interest in opco, a 43.8% limited partner interest in westlake partners (consisting of 14,122,230 common units), a general partner interest in westlake partners and incentive distribution rights. the operations of westlake partners are consolidated in our financial statements. we are party to certain agreements with westlake partners and opco whereby, among other things, opco sells us 95% of the ethylene it produces on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10. we use this ethylene in the production processes of both our olefins and vinyls segments. for more information, see "—olefins business" and "—vinyls business" below.on august 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of axiall corporation ("axiall") for $33.00 per share in an all-cash transaction (the "axiall merger"). axiall was a manufacturer and international marketer of chemicals and building products, with manufacturing sites in north america. after the axiall merger, we are the third-largest global chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest pvc producer in the world.on january 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of nakantm, a global compounding solutions business. nakan's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries. with this acquisition, our compounding business now has facilities worldwide in china, france, germany, italy, japan, mexico, spain, the united states and vietnam, as well as a world-class research facility in france and several application laboratories. we benefit from highly integrated production facilities that allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added chemicals and building products. as of february 13, 2019, we (directly and through opco and our 95%- and 60%-owned joint ventures in china and taiwan, respectively) had approximately 42.1 billion pounds per year of aggregate production capacity at numerous manufacturing sites in north america, europe and asia.1table of contentsolefins businessproductsolefins are the basic building blocks used to create a wide variety of petrochemical products. we manufacture ethylene (through opco), polyethylene, styrene and associated co-products at our manufacturing facility in lake charles and polyethylene at our longview facility. we have two ethylene plants, which are owned by opco, two polyethylene plants and one styrene monomer plant at our olefins facility at our lake charles site. we have three polyethylene plants and a specialty polyethylene wax plant at our longview site.the following table illustrates our production capacities at february 13, 2019 by principal product and the primary end uses of these materials:    product annual capacity     end uses  (millions of pounds)  ethylene (1) 2,990 polyethylene, ethylene dichloride ("edc"), styrene, ethylene oxide/ethylene glycollow-density polyethylene

and building materials______________________________(1)production capacity owned by opco.ethylene. ethylene is the world's most widely used petrochemical in terms of volume. it is the key building block used to produce a large number of higher value-added chemicals including polyethylene, edc, vcm and styrene. opco has the capacity to produce approximately 3.0 billion pounds of ethylene per year at our olefins facility at our lake charles site, and we have the capability to consume all of opco's production that we purchase at lake charles to produce polyethylene and styrene monomer in our olefins business and to produce vcm and edc in our vinyls business. opco also produces ethylene for our vinyls segment at our calvert city site, and substantially all of the ethylene we purchase from opco at calvert city is used internally in the production of vcm. for opco's annual ethylene production that is purchased by us for our vinyls business, see "business—vinyls business." in addition, we (through opco) produce ethylene co-products including chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. we (through opco) sell our entire output of these co-products to external customers. opco completed an upgrade and capacity expansion of its petro 1 ethylene unit at our lake charles site in 2016 which increased opco's ethylene capacity by approximately 250 million pounds annually.polyethylene. polyethylene, the world's most widely consumed polymer, is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of film, coatings and molded product applications primarily used in packaging. polyethylene is generally classified as either ldpe, lldpe or high-density polyethylene ("hdpe"). the density correlates to the relative stiffness of the end-use products. the difference between ldpe and lldpe is molecular, and products produced from lldpe, in general, have higher strength properties than products produced from ldpe. ldpe exhibits better clarity and other physical properties and is used in end products such as bread bags, dry cleaning bags, food wraps, milk carton coatings and food packaging. lldpe is used for higher film strength applications such as stretch film and heavy duty sacks. hdpe is used to manufacture products such as grocery, merchandise and trash bags, rigid plastic containers, plastic closures and pipe.we are the leading producer of ldpe by capacity in north america and predominantly use the autoclave technology (versus tubular technology), which is capable of producing higher margin specialty polyethylene products. in 2018, our annual capacity of approximately 1.5 billion pounds was available in numerous formulations to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. we also have the capacity to produce approximately 1.1 billion pounds of lldpe per year in various formulations. we produce ldpe and lldpe at both the lake charles and longview facilities. our lake charles and longview facilities also have the capability to produce hdpe. we sell polyethylene to external customers as a final product in pellet form.styrene. styrene is used to produce derivatives such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, unsaturated polyester and synthetic rubber. these derivatives are used in a number of applications including consumer disposables, food packaging, housewares, paints and coatings, building materials, tires and toys. we produce styrene at our lake charles plant, where we have the capacity to produce approximately 570 million pounds of styrene per year, all of which is sold to external customers.2table of contentsfeedstockswe are highly integrated along our olefins product chain. we (through opco) produce most of the ethylene required to produce our polyethylene and styrene. ethylene can be produced from either petroleum liquid feedstocks, such as naphtha, condensates and gas oils, or from natural gas liquid feedstocks, such as ethane, propane and butane. both of opco's lake charles ethylene plants use ethane as the primary feedstock. pursuant to a feedstock supply agreement between us and opco, opco receives ethane feedstock at the olefins facility at our lake charles site through several pipelines from a variety of suppliers in texas and louisiana. we own a 50% interest in a 104-mile natural gas liquids pipeline from mont belvieu to our lake charles site. opco owns a 200-mile ethylene pipeline that runs from mont belvieu to our longview site.in addition to ethylene supplied by opco, we also acquire ethylene from third parties in order to supply a portion of our ethylene requirements. we acquire butene and hexene to manufacture polyethylene and benzene to manufacture styrene. we receive butene and hexene at the lake charles site and hexene at the longview site via rail car from several suppliers. we receive benzene via barges, ships and pipeline pursuant to short-term arrangements. we purchase butene and hexene pursuant to multi-year contracts, some of which are renewable for an additional term subject to either party to the contract notifying the other party that it does not wish to renew the contract. we purchase electricity for our lake charles facility under long-term industrial contracts.marketing, sales and distributionwe have an internal sales force that sells our products directly to our customers. our polyethylene customers are some of the nation's largest producers of film and flexible packaging.we and opco sell ethylene and ethylene co-products to external customers. opco's primary ethylene co-products are chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. we have storage agreements and exchange agreements that allow us and opco access to customers who are not directly connected to the pipeline system that we own. opco ships crude butadiene and pyrolysis gasoline by rail or truck. additionally, we transport our polyethylene and styrene by rail or truck. further, styrene can be transported by barge or ship.no single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the olefins segment in 2018. competitionthe markets in which our olefins business operates are highly competitive. we compete on the basis of customer service, product deliverability, quality, consistency, performance and price. our competitors in the ethylene, polyethylene and styrene markets are some of the world's largest chemical companies, including chevron phillips chemical company, dowdupont inc., exxonmobil chemical company, formosa plastics corporation, lyondellbasell industries, n.v. and nova chemicals corporation.vinyls businessproductsprincipal products in our integrated vinyls segment include pvc, vcm, edc, chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) and chlorinated derivative products and, through opco, ethylene. we also manufacture and sell pvc compounds and building products fabricated from pvc, including siding, pipe, fittings, profiles, trim, mouldings, fence and decking products, window and door components and film and sheet products. we manage our integrated vinyls production chain, from the basic chemicals to finished building products, to optimize product margins and capacity utilization. our primary north american chemical manufacturing facilities are located in our calvert city, kentucky and lake charles, plaquemine and geismar, louisiana sites. our calvert city site includes an ethylene plant, which is owned by opco, a chlor-alkali plant, a vcm plant and a pvc plant. our lake charles site includes three chlor-alkali plants, two vcm plants, a chlorinated derivative products plant and cogeneration assets. our plaquemine site includes a chlor-alkali plant, a vcm plant, a pvc plant and cogeneration assets. our

its versatility, durability and cost-competitiveness. pvc is produced from vcm, which is, in turn, made from chlorine and ethylene. pvc compounds are highly customized formulations that offer specific end-use properties based on customer-determined manufacturing specifications. pvc compounds are made by combining pvc resin with various additives in order to make either rigid and impact-resistant or soft and flexible compounds. the various compounds are then fabricated into end-products through extrusion, calendering, injection-molding or blow-molding. we are the third-largest pvc producer in the world. we have the capacity to produce approximately 6.0 billion pounds and 1.1 billion pounds of commodity and specialty pvc per year, respectively, at our various facilities globally. we use some of our pvc internally in the production of our building products and pvc compounds. the remainder of our pvc is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets.vcm. vcm is used to produce pvc, solvents and pvc-related products. we use ethylene and chlorine to produce vcm. we have the capacity to produce approximately 6.0 billion pounds and 1.5 billion pounds of vcm per year at our north american and european facilities, respectively. the majority of our vcm is used internally in our pvc operations. vcm not used internally is sold to other vinyl resins producers in domestic and international markets.chlorine and caustic soda. we combine salt and electricity to produce chlorine and caustic soda, commonly referred to as chlor-alkali, at our lake charles, plaquemine, natrium, calvert city, geismar, beauharnois, longview, gendorf, and knapsack, germany and kaohsiung facilities. we are the third-largest chlor-alkali producer in the world. we use our chlorine production in our vcm and chlorinated derivative products plants. we currently have the capacity to supply all of our chlorine requirements internally. any remaining chlorine is sold into the merchant chlorine market. our caustic soda is sold to external customers who use it for, among other things, the production of pulp and paper, organic and inorganic chemicals and alumina.4table of contentschlorinated derivative products. our chlorinated derivative products include ethyl chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tri-ethane® solvents, versatrans® solvents, calcium hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid ("hcl") and pelletized caustic soda ("pels"). we have the capacity to produce approximately 2.3 billion pounds of chlorinated derivative products per year, primarily at our lake charles, natrium, beauharnois and longview facilities. the majority of our chlorinated derivative products are sold to external customers who use these products for, among other things, refrigerants, water treatment applications, chemicals and pharmaceutical production, food processing, steel pickling, solvent and cleaning chemicals and natural gas and oil production.ethylene. we use the ethylene we purchase that is produced by opco at calvert city to produce vcm. opco's calvert city ethylene plant has the capacity to partially supply the ethylene required for our total vcm production. we obtain the remainder of the ethylene we need for our vinyls business from opco's lake charles plants and from third party purchases. opco's calvert city ethylene plant utilizes ethane feedstock and enables us, through opco, to enhance our vinyl chain integration. in 2017, opco completed an expansion project to increase the ethylene capacity of its ethylene plant at our calvert city facility. the expansion along with other initiatives, increased ethylene capacity by approximately 100 million pounds annually.building products and pvc compounds. products made from pvc are used in construction materials ranging from water and sewer systems to home and commercial applications for siding, trim, mouldings, fence, deck, window and door systems. our building products consist of two primary product groups: (i) exterior products, which includes siding, trim, mouldings, window profiles, fence and decking products; and (ii) pvc pipe, specialty pvc pipe and fittings. we manufacture and market exterior products under the royal building products®, celect cellular exteriors by royal®, zuri premium decking by royal®, royal s4s trim board® and exterior portfolio® brand names. we manufacture and market specialty pipe and fittings, water, sewer, irrigation and conduit pipe products under the north american pipe® and royal building products® brand names. we manufacture film and sheet at our shanghai facility for both asian and global markets. flexible pvc compounds are used for wire and cable insulation, medical films and packaging, flooring, wall coverings, automotive interior and exterior trims and packaging. rigid extrusion pvc compounds are commonly used in window and door profiles, vertical blinds and construction products, including pipe and siding. injection-molding pvc compounds are used in specialty products such as computer housings and keyboards, appliance parts and bottles. powder compounds are primarily used in window and door profiles and pipe and fittings. all of our building products and pvc compounds are sold to external customers. the combined capacity of our 36 building products and pvc compounds plants is approximately 3.4 billion pounds per year.feedstocks we are highly integrated along our vinyls production chain. we produce most of the ethylene required by our calvert city and geismar facilities (through opco). ethylene produced at opco's calvert city facility utilizes ethane feedstock. we purchase the remainder of the ethylene required for our other north american and european facilities from a number of sources under various contracts. we are party to a joint venture, lacc, llc ("lacc"), with lotte chemical usa corporation to build an ethylene facility, that will have 2.2 billion pounds per year of ethylene production capacity. the lacc ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in lake charles. pursuant to an agreement with lacc, we will receive 50% of the ethylene produced at lacc starting from 2019 based on the anticipated start-up of the facility in the first half of 2019. we have access to, and partially own, an ethylene pipeline in germany. the salt requirements for several of our larger chlor-alkali plants are supplied internally from salt domes we either own or lease and is transported by pipelines we own. we purchase the salt required for our other chlor-alkali plants pursuant to long-term contracts. electricity and steam for one of our lake charles facilities are produced by both on-site cogeneration units and through a toll arrangement with rs cogen, llc ("rs cogen"), a joint venture in which we own a 50% interest. rs cogen operates a process steam, natural gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacent to the site. electricity and steam for the plaquemine facility is supplied internally by our on-site cogeneration unit. a portion of our natrium facility's electricity requirements is produced by our on-site generation unit, and the remainder is purchased. we purchase electricity for our remaining facilities under long-term contracts. we purchase vcm for our asian pvc plant on a contract and spot basis. our north american and asian pvc facilities supply predominantly all of the pvc required for our building products plants. pvc required for the pvc compounds plants is either internally sourced or externally purchased at market prices based on the location of the plants. the remaining feedstocks include pigments, fillers, stabilizers and other ingredients, which we purchase under short-term contracts based on prevailing market prices.5table of contentsmarketing, sales and distributionwe have a dedicated sales force for our business, organized by product line and region. in addition, we rely on distributors to market products to smaller customers. we use some of our pvc internally in the production of our building products and pvc compounds. the remainder of our pvc is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets. we have the capacity to use a majority of our chlorine internally to produce vcm and edc, most of which, in turn, is used to produce pvc. we also use our chlorine internally to produce chlorinated derivative products. we sell the remainder of our chlorine and substantially all of our caustic soda production to external customers. the majority of our products are shipped from production

being sold to customers.we are the second largest manufacturer of pvc pipe by capacity in the united states. we sell a majority of our siding, trim and mouldings products, pvc pipe, specialty pvc pipe and fittings, and film and sheet products through a combination of our internal sales force and manufacturer's representatives. in canada, we operate 19 company-owned distribution branches that sell our vinyl siding and accessories and trim and mouldings products, as well as pipe and fittings. we also engage in advertising programs primarily directed at trade professionals that are intended to develop awareness and interest in our products. in addition, we display our building products at trade shows.no single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the vinyls segment in 2018.competitionthe markets in which our vinyls business operates are highly competitive. competition in the vinyls market is based on product availability, product performance, customer service and price. we compete in the vinyls market with other producers including formosa plastics corporation, oxy chem, lp, shintech, inc., olin corporation, polyone corp., teknor apex company, inc., mexichem, s.a.b. de c.v., inovyn chlorvinyls limited, vynova group and kem one group sas.competition in the building products market is based on on-time delivery, product quality, product innovation, customer service, product consistency and price. we compete in the building products market with other producers and fabricators including diamond plastics corporation, jm eagle inc., ply gem holdings, inc., certainteed corporation, ipex inc., associated materials llc and the azek company.environmentalas is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business. national, state or provincial and local standards regulating air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. compliance with such laws and regulations has required and will continue to require capital expenditures and increase operating costs.it is our policy to comply with all environmental, health and safety requirements and to provide safe and environmentally sound workplaces for our employees. in some cases, compliance can be achieved only by incurring capital expenditures. in 2018, we made capital expenditures of $23 million related to environmental compliance. we estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $47 million in 2019 and $45 million in 2020, respectively, related to environmental compliance. the expected 2019 and 2020 capital expenditures are relatively higher than the amounts we have spent related to environmental compliance in recent years in large part due to capital expenditures related to environmental protection agency (the "epa") regulations. the remainder of the 2019 and 2020 estimated expenditures are related to equipment replacement and upgrades. we anticipate that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general. although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures, management believes that our current spending trends will continue.from time to time, we receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. item 103 of the sec's regulation s-k requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, unless we reasonably believe such sanctions would not exceed $100,000.6table of contents•in may 2013, an amendment to an existing consent order agreed to by the west virginia department of environmental protection and a predecessor of axiall required that it, among other things, pay a penalty in the amount of $449,000 and continue certain corrective actions associated with discharges of hexachlorocyclohexane (commonly referred to as bhc) from the natrium facility's effluent discharge outfalls. the penalty was paid and corrective actions required are on-going per a december 2018 agreement to extend the compliance date under the amended consent order. the amended consent order also imposes stipulated penalties for exceedances of the facility's interim effluent discharge limits, which penalties we believe may, in the aggregate, reach or exceed $100,000.•during september 2010, our vinyls facilities in lake charles and plaquemine each received a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty, alleging violations of various requirements of those facilities' air permits, based largely on self-reported permit deviations related to record-keeping violations. we have been negotiating a possible global settlement of these and several other matters with the louisiana department of environmental quality ("ldeq"). in may 2018, we reached an agreement in principal with the ldeq to resolve these consolidated enforcement matters for a penalty of $162,500. the settlement agreement is being prepared and when finalized will be subject to public comment and approval by the louisiana attorney general. •for several years, the epa has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. on april 21, 2014, we received a clean air act section 114 information request from the epa which sought information regarding flares at the calvert city facility and certain lake charles facilities. the epa has informed us that the information provided leads the epa to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. the epa has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate us to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. we believe the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.•regional offices of the epa have investigated, and in some cases inspected, our compliance with risk management program requirements under the clean air act at our natrium and geismar facilities. we believe the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.•on november 24, 2014, we entered into an agreed order with the kentucky energy and environmental cabinet ("keec") regarding our kentucky pollutant discharge elimination system permit limits for hexachlorobenzene and mercury at our calvert city facility. on july 9, 2018, we and the keec entered into a new agreed order under which we will be subject to new interim discharge limits for hexachlorobenzene in addition to accompanying stipulated penalties for exceedances of those interim discharge limits, which penalties we believe may, in the aggregate, reach or exceed $100,000.we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.also see our discussion of our environmental matters contained in item 1a, "risk factors" below, item 3, "legal proceedings" below and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included

petrochemical industry has in the past, and may in the future, result in reduced operating margins or operating losses.our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the petrochemical industry. the industry is mature and capital intensive. margins in this industry are sensitive to supply and demand balances both domestically and internationally, which historically have been cyclical. the cycles are generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by periods of oversupply primarily resulting from excess new capacity additions, leading to reduced operating rates and lower margins.moreover, profitability in the petrochemical industry is affected by the worldwide level of demand along with vigorous price competition which may intensify due to, among other things, new industry capacity. in general, weak economic conditions either in the united states, europe or the rest of the world tend to reduce demand and put pressure on margins. it is not possible to predict accurately the supply and demand balances, market conditions and other factors that will affect industry operating margins in the future.new olefins capacity additions in asia, the middle east and north america, a number of which have been recently completed, may lead to periods of over-supply and lower profitability. as a result, our olefins segment operating margins may be negatively impacted.we sell commodity products in highly competitive markets and face significant competition and price pressure.we sell our products in highly competitive markets. due to the commodity nature of many of our products, competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on performance, product quality, product deliverability and customer service. as a result, we generally are not able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers. accordingly, increases in raw material and other costs may not necessarily correlate with changes in prices for these products, either in the direction of the price change or in magnitude. specifically, timing differences in pricing between raw material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated monthly or less often, sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability. significant volatility in raw material costs tends to place pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers could seek relief in the form of lower sales prices.8table of contentsvolatility in costs of raw materials and energy may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.significant variations in the costs and availability of raw materials and energy may negatively affect our results of operations. these costs have risen significantly in the past due primarily to oil and natural gas cost increases. we purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt to produce several basic chemicals. we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. the cost of these raw materials and energy, in the aggregate, represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. the prices of raw materials and energy generally follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for, crude oil and natural gas, which are highly volatile and cyclical. changes to regulatory policies applicable to the german energy sector for industrial users have contributed to higher prices for industrial users of energy in the future. our results of operations have been and could in the future be significantly affected by increases in these costs.price increases increase our working capital needs and, accordingly, can adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows. in addition, because we utilize the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method of inventory accounting, during periods of falling raw material prices and declining sales prices, our results of operations for a particular reporting period could be negatively impacted as the lower sales prices would be reflected in operating income more quickly than the corresponding drop in feedstock costs. we use derivative instruments in an attempt to reduce price volatility risk on some feedstock commodities. in the future, we may decide not to hedge any of our raw material costs or any hedges we enter into may not have successful results. also, our hedging activities involve credit risk associated with our hedging counterparties, and a deterioration in the financial markets could adversely affect our hedging counterparties and their abilities to fulfill their obligations to us.lower prices of crude oil, such as those experienced from the third quarter of 2014 through 2018 (at december 31, 2018, approximately 58% lower than their 2014 peak levels), led to a reduction in the cost advantage for natural gas liquids-based ethylene crackers in north america, such as ours, as compared to naphtha-based ethylene crackers . as a result, our margins and cash flows were negatively impacted. lower crude oil and natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in hydraulic fracturing in the united states, which could reduce the availability of feedstock and increase prices of feedstock for our operations. higher natural gas prices could also adversely affect our ability to export products that we produce in the united states outside of the united states. in addition to the impact that this has on our exports from the united states, reduced competitiveness of u.s. producers also has in the past increased the availability of chemicals in north america, as u.s. production that would otherwise have been sold overseas was instead offered for sale domestically, resulting in excess supply and lower prices in north america. we could also face the threat of imported products from countries that have a cost advantage. additionally, the export of natural gas liquids from the united states or greater restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could restrict the availability of our raw materials in the united states, thereby increasing our costs.external factors beyond our control can cause fluctuations in demand for our products and in our prices and margins, which may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.external factors beyond our control can cause volatility in raw material prices, demand for our products, product prices and volumes and deterioration in operating margins. these factors can also magnify the impact of economic cycles on our business and results of operations. examples of external factors include:•general economic conditions, including in the united states, europe and asia;•new capacity additions in north america, europe, asia and the middle east;•the level of business activity in the industries that use our products;•competitor action;•technological innovations;•currency fluctuations;•increases in interest rates;•international events and circumstances;•war, sabotage, terrorism and civil unrest;•governmental regulation, including in the united states, europe and asia;•severe weather and natural disasters; and•credit worthiness of customers and vendors.9table of contentsa number of our products are highly dependent on durable goods markets, such as housing and construction, which are themselves particularly cyclical. weakness in the u.s. residential housing market and economic weakness in europe could have an adverse effect on demand and margins for our products. if the global economy worsens in general, or the u.s. residential housing market or the european economy worsens in particular, demand for our products and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.we may reduce production at or idle a facility for an extended period of time or exit a business because of high raw material prices, an oversupply of a particular product and/or a lack of demand for that particular product, which makes production uneconomical. temporary outages sometimes last for several quarters or, in certain cases, longer and cause us to incur costs, including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities. factors such as increases in raw material costs or lower demand in the future may cause us to further reduce operating rates, idle facilities or exit uncompetitive businesses.hostilities in the middle east or elsewhere or the occurrence, or threat of occurrence, of terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states, europe and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in demand for our products, which could adversely affect our net sales and margins and limit our future growth prospects. volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas could also result in increased feedstock costs. furthermore, sustained lower prices of crude oil, such as the prices experienced from the third quarter of 2014 through 2018, have led and may lead to lower margins in the united states. in addition, these risks could cause increased instability in the financial and insurance markets and could adversely affect our ability to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate or is otherwise required by our contracts with third parties.we operate internationally and are subject to related risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risk and other risks relating to international operations.we operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing business on a global basis. these risks include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations, imposition of trade barriers (which could, among other things, negatively impact our ability to export our products outside of the u.s.), imposition of tariffs and duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, changes in law and regulatory requirements, involvement in judicial proceedings in unfavorable jurisdictions, economic instability and disruptions, political unrest and epidemics. if the u.s. administration makes certain changes to its foreign trade policies, such changes could lead to imposition of additional trade barriers and tariffs on us in foreign jurisdictions. our operating results could be negatively affected by any of these risks.a deterioration in global economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.a deterioration in global economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business and our financial condition. our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the availability of additional financing at cost effective interest rates cannot be assured. a deterioration in global economic conditions could have an impact on the lenders under our revolving credit facility or on our customers and suppliers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. additionally, a deterioration in global economic conditions could result in reduced demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our revenues and profits.our inability to compete successfully may reduce our operating profits.the petrochemical industry is highly competitive. historically, there have been a number of mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and joint ventures in the industry. this restructuring activity has resulted in fewer but more competitive producers, many of which are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we do. among our competitors are some of the world's largest chemical companies and chemical industry joint ventures. competition within the petrochemical industry and in the manufacturing of building products is affected by a variety of factors, including:•product price;•balance of product supply/demand;•material, technology and process innovation;•technical support and customer service;•quality;•reliability of raw material and utility supply;•availability of potential substitute materials; and•product performance.10table of contentschanges in the competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operations. these changes could include:•the emergence of new domestic and international competitors;•the rate of capacity additions by competitors;•changes in customer base due to mergers;•the intensification of price competition in our markets;•the introduction of new or substitute products by competitors; and•the technological innovations of competitors.our production facilities process some volatile and hazardous materials that subject us to operating risks that could adversely affect our operating results.we have manufacturing sites in the united states, europe and asia. our operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with chemical, plastics and building products manufacturing and the related use, storage, transportation and disposal of feedstocks, products and wastes, including:•pipeline leaks and ruptures;•explosions;•fires;•severe weather and natural disasters;•mechanical failure;•unscheduled downtime;•labor difficulties;•transportation interruptions;•transportation accidents involving our products;•remediation complications;•chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases;•other environmental risks;•sabotage;•terrorist attacks; and•political unrest.according to some experts, global climate change could result in heightened hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and other weather and natural disaster hazards worldwide. if this materializes, severe weather and natural disaster hazards could pose an even greater risk for our facilities, particularly those in louisiana.all these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, catastrophic damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. we could become subject to environmental claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. a loss or shutdown over an extended period of operations at any one of our chemical manufacturing facilities would have a material adverse effect on us. we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance that we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices, but we cannot be fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from war risks or terrorist acts. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.11table of contentswe are exposed to significant losses from products liability, personal injury and other claims relating to the products we manufacture. additionally, individuals currently seek, and likely will continue to seek, damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to alleged exposure to chemicals at our facilities or to chemicals otherwise owned, controlled or manufactured by us. we are also subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other matters. any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. we maintain and expect to continue to maintain insurance for products liability, workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other claims, but the amount and scope of such insurance may not be adequate or available to cover a claim that is successfully asserted against us. in addition, such insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.we rely on a limited number of outside suppliers for specified feedstocks and services.we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from a few key suppliers. if any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under any present or future supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials. any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. a vendor may choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship due to general economic concerns or concerns relating to the vendor or us, at any time. any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers, or any significant additional requirements from our suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or with letters of credits, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.we rely heavily on third party transportation, which subjects us to risks and costs that we cannot control. such risks and costs may materially adversely affect our operations.we rely heavily on railroads, barges, pipelines, ships, trucks and other shipping companies to transport raw materials to the manufacturing facilities used by our businesses and to ship finished products to customers. these transport operations are subject to various hazards and risks, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages and operating hazards (including pipeline leaks and ruptures and storage tank leaks), as well as interstate transportation regulations. in addition, the methods of transportation we utilize, including shipping chlorine and other chemicals by railroad, may be subject to additional, more stringent and more costly regulations in the future. if we are delayed or unable to ship finished products or unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any such new regulations or public policy changes related to transportation safety, or these transportation companies fail to operate properly, or if there were significant changes in the cost of these services due to new or additional regulations, or otherwise, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship goods, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.we may pursue acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures and/or other transactions that may impact our results of operations and financial condition.we seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and create stockholder value through various transactions. these transactions may include domestic and international business combinations, purchases or sales of assets or contractual arrangements or joint ventures that are intended to result in the realization of synergies, the creation of efficiencies or the generation of cash to reduce debt. in this regard, we regularly consider acquisition opportunities that would be consistent or complementary to our existing business strategies. to the extent permitted under our credit facility, the indenture governing our senior notes and other debt agreements, some of these transactions may be financed by additional borrowings by us. although we would pursue these transactions because we expect them to yield longer-term benefits if the efficiencies and synergies we expect are realized, they could adversely affect our results of operations in the short term because of the costs associated with such transactions and because they may divert management's attention from existing business operations. other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of our businesses, thereby yielding increased short-term liquidity, but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term. these transactions may not yield the business benefits, synergies or financial benefits anticipated by management. integration of other acquired operations can lead to restructuring charges or other costs. we may have difficulties integrating the operations of other acquired businesses.12table of contentsour operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.we use large quantities of hazardous substances and generate large quantities of hazardous wastes and emissions in our manufacturing operations. due to the large quantities of hazardous substances and wastes, our industry is highly regulated and monitored by various environmental regulatory authorities such as the epa, federal or state analogs in other countries and the european union, which promulgated the industrial emission directive ("ied"). as such, we are subject to extensive international, national, state and local laws, regulations and directives pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety, which govern, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges onto land or waters, the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace, the remediation of contaminated sites, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. some of these laws, regulations and directives are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations. many of these laws, regulations and directives provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or reduce the likelihood or impact of hazardous substance releases, whether permitted or not. for example, all of our petrochemical facilities in the united states and europe may require improvements to comply with certain changes in process safety management requirements.new laws, rules and regulations as well as changes to laws, rules and regulations may also affect us. for example, on april 17, 2012, the epa promulgated maximum achievable control technology ("mact") standards for major sources and generally available control technology ("gact") standards for area sources of pvc production. the rule sets emission limits and work practice standards for total organic air toxics and for three specific air toxics: vinyl chloride, chlorinated di-benzo dioxins and furans ("cd/df"), and hydrogen chloride and includes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission standards. while this rule is the subject of legal challenge and epa reconsideration, the rule is not stayed.in march 2011, the epa proposed amendments to the emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for mercury emissions from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. these proposed amendments would require improvements in work practices to reduce fugitive mercury emissions. we operate a mercury cell production unit at our natrium facility. we cannot predict the timing or content of the final regulation, or its ultimate cost to, or impact on us.our operations produce greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions, which have been the subject of increased scrutiny and regulation. in december 2015, the united states joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris, france. the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. the united states signed the paris agreement in april 2016, and the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016. however, in june 2017, the trump administration announced that the united states intends to withdraw from the paris agreement. pursuant to the terms of the paris agreement, the earliest date the united states can effectively withdraw is november 2020. the united states' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. legislation to regulate ghg emissions has also been introduced in the united states congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.various jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws and regulations on ghg emissions, with the general aim of reducing such emissions. the epa currently requires certain industrial facilities to report their ghg emissions, and to obtain permits with stringent control requirements before constructing or modifying new facilities with significant ghg emissions. in the european union, the emissions trading scheme obligates certain emitters to obtain ghg emission allowances to comply with a cap and trade system for ghg emissions. in addition, the european union has committed to reduce domestic ghg emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. as our chemical manufacturing processes result in ghg emissions, these and other ghg laws and regulations could affect our costs of doing business.13table of contentssimilarly, the toxic substances control act ("tsca") imposes reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to the production, handling, and use of chemical substances. the tsca reform legislation enacted in june 2016 expanded the epa's authority to review and regulate new and existing chemicals. under the reform legislation, epa is required to, among other things, undertake rule making within statutory time frames related to: (1) chemical risk evaluation, designation and management; (2) reporting of mercury supply, use and trade; and (3) management of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemical substances (pbts). rules issued by epa in 2017 and 2018, implementing aspects of the tsca reform legislation have been challenged. one rule establishes the epa's process and criteria for identifying high priority chemicals for risk evaluation. another rule sets the epa's approach for determining whether these high priority chemicals present an unreasonable risk to health or the environment. in addition to these two rules, the tsca inventory reset rule required industry reporting of chemicals manufactured or processed in the united states over the past 10 years, from which epa will determine which substances are active or inactive on the existing inventory. a final mercury reporting rule published in june 2018 requires manufacturers, including manufacturers who intentionally use mercury in a manufacturing process, to report information about their mercury supply, use and trade. the first periodic report under the new mercury reporting rule is due july 1, 2019. epa will use the information collected to develop an inventory of mercury and mercury-added products as well as mercury-use manufacturing processes. the epa may then recommend actions or promulgate further rules aimed at reducing mercury use. we cannot predict the timing or content of these actions or rules, or their ultimate cost to, or impact on us.under the ied, european union member state governments are expected to adopt rules and implement environmental permitting programs relating to air, water and waste for industrial facilities. in this context, concepts such as the "best available technique" are being explored. future implementation of these concepts may result in technical modifications in our european facilities. in addition, under the environmental liability directive, european union member states can require the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination in certain circumstances, under the "polluter pays principle." we are unable to predict the impact these requirements and concepts may have on our future costs of compliance.these rules or future new, amended or proposed laws or rules could increase our costs or reduce our production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. in addition, we cannot accurately predict future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental and safety laws or regulations, and inspection and enforcement policies, as well as resulting higher compliance costs, which might affect the handling, manufacture, use, emission, disposal or remediation of products, other materials or hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities and costs under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these liabilities and costs may be material.we also may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our facilities or to chemicals that we otherwise manufacture, handle or own. although these types of claims have not historically had a material impact on our operations, a significant increase in the success of these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.environmental laws may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of, and responsibility for, cleanup of contamination at our current and former operating facilities, the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, the costs of reducing emissions and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater. the u.s. comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act ("cercla"), similar state laws and certain european directives impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that generated waste, arranged for disposal of the wastes, transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites. all such potentially responsible parties (or any one of them, including us) may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. in addition, cercla, similar state laws and certain european directives could impose liability for damages to natural resources caused by contamination.although we seek to take preventive action, our operations are inherently subject to accidental spills, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances that may make us liable to governmental entities or private parties. this may involve contamination associated with our current and former facilities, facilities to which we sent wastes or by-products for treatment or disposal and other contamination. accidental discharges may occur in the future, future action may be taken in connection with past discharges, governmental agencies may assess damages or penalties against us in connection with any past or future contamination, or third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. in addition, we may be liable for existing contamination related to certain of our facilities for which, in some cases, we believe third parties are liable in the event such third parties fail to perform their obligations.14table of contentscapital projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.we have capital expansion plans for our facilities. expansion projects may be subject to delays or cost overruns, including delays or cost overruns resulting from any one or more of the following:•unexpectedly long delivery times for, or shortages of, key equipment, parts or materials;•shortages of skilled labor and other personnel necessary to perform the work;•delays and performance issues;•failures or delays of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;•unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials;•work stoppages and other labor disputes;•unanticipated actual or purported change orders;•disputes with contractors and suppliers;•design and engineering problems;•latent damages or deterioration to equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;•financial or other difficulties of our contractors and suppliers;•sabotage;•terrorist attacks;•interference from adverse weather conditions; and•difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions.significant cost overruns or delays could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, actual capital expenditures could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures.our level of debt could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.as of december 31, 2018, our indebtedness, including the current portion, totaled $2.7 billion, and our debt represented approximately 31% of our total capitalization. our annual interest expense for 2018 was $126 million, net of interest capitalized of $7 million. our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our existing or future debt agreements could have significant consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt and will not be available for other purposes;•we may not be able to obtain necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes;•our less leveraged competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have greater flexibility to utilize their cash flows to improve their operations;•we may be exposed to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which would result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates;•we could be vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business that would leave us less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions; and•should we pursue additional expansions of existing assets or acquisition of third party assets, we may not be able to obtain additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates.these factors could be magnified or accelerated to the extent we were to finance future acquisitions with significant amounts of debt.15table of contentsto service our indebtedness and fund our capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and pay cash dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, including any distributions that we may receive from westlake partners. this is subject to general economic, financial, currency, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, we may not receive sufficient distributions from westlake partners, and currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule. we also generate revenues denominated in currencies other than that of our indebtedness and may have difficulty converting those revenues into the currency of our indebtedness. we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. in addition, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our credit facility and our senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. all of these factors could be magnified if we were to finance any future acquisitions with significant amounts of debt. the credit agreement and the indenture governing certain of our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions.the credit agreement and the indenture governing certain of our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability to:•pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;•make investments and other restricted payments;•incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;•create liens;•permit dividend or other payment restrictions on our restricted subsidiaries;•sell all or substantially all of our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;•engage in transactions with affiliates; and•engage in sale-leaseback transactions.these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. currently, many of these restrictions in the indenture governing certain of our senior notes are suspended under the indenture because those notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a quarterly total leverage ratio.these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance future business opportunities or acquisitions. a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related debt. if a default occurred, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. in addition, any acceleration of debt under the credit agreement will constitute a default under some of our other debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes.our participation in joint ventures and similar arrangements exposes us to a number of risks, including risks of shared control.we are party to several joint ventures and similar arrangements, including an investment, together with lotte chemical usa corporation ("lotte"), in a joint venture, lacc, llc ("lacc"), to build an ethylene facility. our participation in joint ventures and similar arrangements, by their nature, requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. in particular, with respect to our investment in lacc, we are a 10% holder and, therefore, our partner lotte will have primary control over operations, including management of the contractors responsible for constructing the ethylene facility. if there are differences in views among joint venture participants in how to operate a joint venture that result in delayed decisions or the failure to make decisions, or our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan and fulfill its obligations. in that case, we may be required to write down the value of our investment in a joint venture, increase the level of financial or other commitments to the joint venture or, if we have contractual agreements with the joint venture, our operations may be materially adversely affected. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.16table of contentslacc may incur additional costs or delays in the construction of the lacc ethylene facility.we have a commitment to contribute up to $225 million toward the construction of the lacc ethylene facility, which equates to approximately 10% of the equity in lacc. if there are cost overruns, our investment could be diluted below 10% if we do not make additional contributions to maintain our ownership position. the construction of the lacc ethylene facility without delays or significant cost overruns is subject to substantial risks, including:•shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor;•labor costs and productivity;•work stoppages;•contractor or supplier delay or non-performance under construction or other agreements or non-performance by other major participants in construction projects;•delays in or failure to receive necessary permits, approvals, tax credits, and other regulatory authorizations;•delays associated with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, system integration, and operations, and/or unforeseen engineering problems;•changes in project design or scope;•impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;•the outcome of legal challenges to projects, including legal challenges to regulatory approvals;•failure to construct in accordance with licensing requirements;•continued public and policymaker support for such projects;•adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;•sabotage;•terrorist attacks;•environmental and geological conditions;•delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities; and•other unanticipated cost increases.regulations concerning the transportation of hazardous chemicals and the security of chemical manufacturing facilities could result in higher operating costs.targets such as chemical manufacturing facilities may be at greater risk of terrorist attacks than other targets. as a result, the chemical industry responded to the issues surrounding the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 by implementing initiatives relating to the security of chemicals industry facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals. simultaneously, local, state, national and international governments put into effect a regulatory process that led to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals. our business or our customers' businesses could be adversely affected because of the cost of complying with these regulations.a change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. a material change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.17table of contentswe may have difficulties integrating the operations of future acquired businesses, including the operations of nakan.if we are unable to integrate or to successfully manage the nakan operations or other businesses that we may acquire in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, cost savings or other benefits expected from the acquisition of nakan and other acquisitions for a number of reasons, including the following:•we may fail to integrate the businesses we acquire into a cohesive, efficient enterprise;•our resources, including management resources, are limited and may be strained if we engage in a large acquisition or significant number of acquisitions, and acquisitions may divert our management's attention from initiating or carrying out programs to save costs or enhance revenues; and•our failure to retain key employees and contracts of the businesses we acquire.future acquisitions could lead to significant restructuring or other changes.regulations related to "conflict minerals" could adversely impact our business.the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 ("dodd-frank act") contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries (collectively, the "covered countries"). the term "conflict minerals" encompasses tantalum, tin, tungsten (and their ores) and gold.in august 2012, pursuant to the dodd-frank act, the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements applicable to any company that files periodic public reports with the sec, if any conflicts minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that company. these annual reporting requirements require companies to describe reasonable country of origin inquiries, due diligence measures and the results of those activities and related determinations.because we have a highly complex, multi-layered supply chain, we may incur significant costs to comply with these requirements. in addition, the implementation of procedures to comply with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials, including components, used in our products. our suppliers (or suppliers to our suppliers) may not be able or willing to provide all requested information or to take other steps necessary to ensure that no conflict minerals financing or benefiting armed groups are included in materials or components supplied to us for our manufacturing purposes. also, we may encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased by them to be certified as conflict free. if we are not able to meet customer certification requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier. in addition, since the applicability of the new conflict minerals requirements is limited to companies that file periodic reports with the sec, not all of our competitors will need to comply with these requirements unless they are imposed by customers. as a result, those competitors may have cost and other advantages over us.our operations could be adversely affected by labor relations.the vast majority of our employees in europe, and some of our employees in north america, are represented by labor unions and works councils. our operations may be adversely affected by strikes, work stoppages and other labor disputes.we have certain material pension and other post-retirement employment benefit ("opeb") obligations. future funding obligations related to these obligations could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements or require us to borrow additional funds.we have u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans covering certain current and former employees. certain non-u.s. defined benefit plans associated with our european operations have not been funded and we are not obligated to fund those plans under applicable law. as of december 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligations for our pension and opeb plans were approximately $784 million and $70 million, respectively. the fair value of pension investment assets was $503 million as of december 31, 2018. the total underfunded status of the pension obligations calculated on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december 31, 2018 was approximately $281 million, including the westlake defined benefit plan, which was underfunded by approximately $135 million on an individual plan basis.18table of contentsthe unfunded opeb obligations as of december 31, 2018 were approximately $70 million. we will require future operating cash flows to fund our pension and opeb obligations, which could restrict available cash for our operations, capital expenditures and other requirements. we may also not generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations, which could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.if our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant.under gaap, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. other intangible assets are reviewed if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. the process of impairment testing for our goodwill and intangible assets involves a number of judgments and estimates made by management including the fair values of assets and liabilities, future cash flows, our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions, overall economic conditions and our strategic operational plans with regards to our business units. if the judgments and estimates used in our analysis are not realized or change due to external factors, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments and estimates, and our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. if our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which could be significant and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.the trading price of our common stock may negatively impact us.volatility in the capital and credit markets may cause downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability. a decline in the market value of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to raise any equity capital.failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security due to internal or external factors including cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products or cause standard business processes to become ineffective, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of information or damage to our reputation. while we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and disaster recovery and incident response plans, our employees, systems, networks, products, facilities and services remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-assault, and, as such, there can be no assurance that a system failure, network disruption or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our consolidated financial results.we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net sales, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in various currencies might occur in one or many of such currencies over time. from time to time, we may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, including, in particular, the euro and the canadian dollar, could nevertheless materially adversely affect our financial results.in addition, we are exposed to volatility in interest rates. when appropriate, we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. however, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations.19table of contentsour property insurance has only partial coverage for acts of terrorism and, in the event of terrorist attack, we could lose net sales and our facilities.as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 and other events, our insurance carriers created certain exclusions for losses from terrorism from our property insurance policies. while separate terrorism insurance coverage is available, premiums for full coverage are very expensive, especially for chemical facilities, and the policies are subject to high deductibles. available terrorism coverage typically excludes coverage for losses from acts of war and from acts of foreign governments as well as nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. we have determined that it is not economically prudent to obtain full terrorism insurance, especially given the significant risks that are not covered by such insurance. where feasible we have secured some limited terrorism insurance coverage on our property where insurers have included it in their overall programs. in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our facilities, we could lose the net sales from the facilities and the facilities themselves, and could become liable for any contamination or for personal or property damage due to exposure to hazardous materials caused by any catastrophic release that may result from a terrorist attack.westlake partners' tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation. we depend in part on distributions from westlake partners to generate cash for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and other uses. if the internal revenue service ("irs") were to treat westlake partners as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or if westlake partners become subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, its cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced, which would also likely cause a substantial reduction in the value of its common units that we hold.despite the fact that westlake partners is organized as a limited partnership under delaware law, it would be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes unless it satisfies a "qualifying income" requirement (the "qualifying income exception") under section 7704 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). failure to meet the qualifying income exception would cause westlake partners to be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes.prior to its initial public offering, westlake partners requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, income from the production, transportation, storage and marketing of ethylene and its co-products constitutes "qualifying income" within the meaning of section 7704 of the code. failure to meet the qualifying income exception or a change in current law could cause westlake partners to be treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject westlake partners to taxation as an entity.we will be controlled by our principal stockholder and its affiliates as long as they own a majority of our common stock, and our other stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting during that time. our interests may conflict with those of the principal stockholder and its affiliates, and we may not be able to resolve these conflicts on terms possible in arms-length transactions.as long as ttwf lp (the "principal stockholder") and its affiliates (the "principal stockholder affiliates") own a majority of our outstanding common stock, they will be able to exert significant control over us, and our other stockholders, by themselves, will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote. as a result, the principal stockholder, subject to any fiduciary duty owed to our minority stockholders under delaware law, will be able to control all matters affecting us (some of which may present conflicts of interest), including:•the composition of our board of directors and, through the board, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and the determination of compensation;•any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets;•our financing decisions, capital raising activities and the payment of dividends; and•amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws.the principal stockholder will be permitted to transfer a controlling interest in us without being required to offer our other stockholders the ability to participate or realize a premium for their shares of common stock. a sale of a controlling interest to a third party may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our business and results of operations because the change in control may result in a change of management decisions and business policy. because we have elected not to be subject to section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware, the principal stockholder may find it easier to sell its controlling interest to a third party than if we had not so elected.20table of contentsin addition to any conflicts of interest that arise in the foregoing areas, our interests may conflict with those of the principal stockholder affiliates in a number of other areas, including:•business opportunities that may be presented to the principal stockholder affiliates and to our officers and directors associated with the principal stockholder affiliates, and competition between the principal stockholder affiliates and us within the same lines of business;•the solicitation and hiring of employees from each other; and•agreements with the principal stockholder affiliates relating to corporate services that may be material to our business.we may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with the principal stockholder affiliates, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party, particularly if the conflicts are resolved while we are controlled by the principal stockholder affiliates. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the principal stockholder affiliates have no duty to refrain from engaging in activities or lines of business similar to ours and that the principal stockholder affiliates will not be liable to us or our stockholders for failing to present specified corporate opportunities to us. item 1b. unresolved staff

of one another. the site includes two ethylene plants, which are owned by opco, two polyethylene plants and a styrene monomer plant. the combined capacity of opco's two lake charles ethylene plants is approximately 3.0 billion pounds per year. the capacity of our two polyethylene plants is approximately 1.5 billion pounds per year and the capacity of our styrene plant is approximately 570 million pounds per year. one of our polyethylene plants has two production units that use gas phase technology with the capability to manufacture both lldpe and hdpe.our lake charles site includes a marine terminal that provides for worldwide shipping capabilities. the site also is located near rail transportation facilities, which allows for efficient delivery of raw materials and prompt shipment of our products to customers. in addition, the site is connected by pipeline systems to our ethylene feedstock sources in both texas and louisiana. within the site, opco's ethylene plants are connected by pipeline systems to our polyethylene and styrene plants.21table of contentsour longview site consists of three polyethylene plants, a specialty polyethylene wax plant, and a 200-mile ethylene pipeline owned by opco that runs from mont belvieu to our longview site. the plants are located inside a large eastman chemical company ("eastman") facility where eastman produces a number of other chemical products. we can access ethylene to support our polyethylene operations either by purchasing ethylene from eastman at the site or by transporting ethylene from opco's lake charles plant into the gulf coast grid and by transporting ethylene through our ethylene pipeline into our longview facility. the technologies we use to produce polyethylene at longview are similar to the technologies that we employ at lake charles. the longview facility has a total capacity of approximately 1.1 billion pounds per year.vinylsour calvert city site is situated on approximately 750 acres on the tennessee river in kentucky and includes an ethylene plant, which is owned by opco, a chlor-alkali plant, a vcm plant and a pvc plant. the capacity of opco's calvert city ethylene plant is approximately 730 million pounds per year and the capacity of our chlor-alkali plant is approximately 550 million pounds of chlorine and 605 million pounds of caustic soda per year. our chlorine plant utilizes efficient, state-of-the-art membrane technology. our vcm plant has a capacity of approximately 1.5 billion pounds per year and our calvert city pvc plant has a capacity of approximately 1.5 billion pounds per year. in january 2017, opco completed an expansion project to increase the ethylene capacity of its ethylene plant at our calvert city facility, which, along with other initiatives, increased ethylene capacity by approximately 100 million pounds annually.our vinyls facility at our lake charles site consists of two tracts of land making up approximately 1,690 acres, each within three miles of the other. the site operates a diverse portfolio of manufacturing plants, including three chlor-alkali plants, two vcm plants, a chlorinated derivative products plant and cogeneration

accepted in the united states is commonly referred to as "gaap." for this purpose a non-gaap financial measure is generally defined by the securities and exchange commission ("sec") as one that purports to measure historical and future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measures. we have included ebitda in this form 10-k because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present ebitda when reporting their results. we regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using ebitda. ebitda allows for meaningful company-to-company performance comparisons by adjusting for factors such as interest expense, depreciation and amortization and taxes, which often vary from company to company. in addition, we utilize ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets. management also believes that ebitda is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and ebitda is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. ebitda is not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings or of cash flows and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. in addition, it should be noted that companies calculate ebitda differently and, therefore, ebitda as presented in this form 10-k may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies. ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes (1) interest expense, which is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenues because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, (2) depreciation, which is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenues because we use capital assets and (3) income taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations. we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally. the following table reconciles ebitda to net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating activities.27table of contentsreconciliation of ebitda to net income, income from operations and net cash provided by operating

condition and results of operationsoverviewwe are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals, polymers and building products. our two principal operating segments are olefins and vinyls. we use the majority of our internally-produced basic chemicals to produce higher value-added chemicals and building products.consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in 1986. our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added chemical products used in many end-markets. petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions. due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed.ethane-based ethylene producers have in the recent past experienced a cost advantage over naphtha-based ethylene producers during periods of higher crude oil prices. this cost advantage has resulted in a strong export market for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives and has benefited operating margins and cash flows for our olefins segment during such periods. however, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by north american ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices from the third quarter of 2014 through 2018, which has resulted in reduced prices and lower margins for our olefins segment. further, our olefins segment has experienced lower profitability in recent periods due to new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in north america and asia that have led to higher global demand for ethane, resulting in higher feedstock costs as well as additional supply of ethylene and polyethylene. looking forward, new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in north america, asia and the middle east will add additional supply and may continue to contribute to periods of lower profitability. however, increasing demand driven by strong economic growth may be able to absorb some of such additional supply. since late 2010, the pvc industry in the u.s. has experienced an increase in pvc resin exports, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in the u.s. as a consequence, the u.s. pvc resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010. in addition, our 2014 acquisition of vinnolit holdings gmbh and its subsidiary companies, an integrated global leader in specialty pvc resins, has contributed to improved operating margins and cash flows for our vinyls segment. with the acquisition of axiall corporation ("axiall") in 2016, westlake is the third-largest chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest pvc producer in the world. globally, there were large chlor-alkali capacity additions between 2008 and 2015 resulting in excess capacity and lower industry operating rates which exerted downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. since 2015, the capacity additions have been outpaced by an increase in demand driven by improving economic growth and u.s. producers' competitive export position, which has resulted in improved operating rates and caustic soda pricing. westlake is the second-largest purchaser of ethylene in the u.s., and lower prices of ethylene could positively impact our vinyls segment. our recent acquisition of nakan is expected to expand our vinyls segment's downstream business and increase our global footprint.we purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains. we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past, and which may do so in the future include: •the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling;•supply and demand for crude oil;•shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand;•ethane and liquefied natural gas exports;•capacity constraints due to higher construction costs for investments, construction delays, strike action or involuntary shutdowns;•the general level of business and economic activity; and•the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.29table of contentssignificant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices. we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs. normally, there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived. when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms, we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship. our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity, our efficient use of that capacity and our ability to increase capacity. since our inception, we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions, new plant construction and internal expansion. we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs. we also regularly look at acquisition opportunities that would be consistent with, or complimentary to, our overall business strategies. depending on the size of the acquisition, any such acquisitions could require external financing.as noted above in item 1a, "risk factors," we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. further, concerns about ghg emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. while we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.non-gaap financial measuresthe body of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is commonly referred to as "gaap." for this purpose, a non-gaap financial measure is generally defined by the sec as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measures. in this report, we disclose non-gaap financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"). ebitda is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. the non-gaap financial measures described in this form 10-k are not substitutes for the gaap measures of earnings and cash flows. ebitda is included in this form 10-k because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present ebitda when reporting their results. we regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using ebitda. in addition, we utilize ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets. management also believes that ebitda is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and ebitda is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. ebitda is not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings or of cash flows and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. in addition, it should be noted that companies calculate ebitda differently and, therefore, ebitda as presented for us may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies. ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes. recent developmentson january 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of nakan, a global compounding solutions business, for approximately $250 million. nakan's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries. on october 4, 2018, westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners") and westlake chemical partners gp llc, the general partner of westlake partners, entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "atm agreement") with ubs securities llc, barclays capital inc., citigroup global markets inc., deutsche bank securities inc., rbc capital markets, llc, merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated

represents a decrease in net income attributable to westlake chemical corporation of $308 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, compared to 2017 net income attributable to westlake chemical corporation of $1,304 million, or $10.00 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,041 million. net income for the year ended december 31, 2018 decreased versus the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 under u.s. tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017 (the "tax act") and higher ethane feedstock costs. these decreases were partially offset by (1) higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda; (2) a lower effective income tax rate resulting from the reduced u.s. corporate income tax rate under the tax act; (3) lower purchased ethylene costs; (4) higher other income, including a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, and higher interest income; and (5) a lower interest expense due to lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. net sales for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased $594 million to $8,635 million compared to net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017 of $8,041 million, mainly due to higher sales

was $1,408 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to $1,225 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $183 million. the increase in income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 was mainly a result of higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and improved operating rates in the vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs for the year ended december 31, 2018 were $33 million, or $0.19 per diluted share after tax, as compared to $29 million in 2017.2018 compared with 2017net sales. net sales increased by $594 million, or 7%, to $8,635 million in 2018 from

costs and improved operating rates in the vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to 2017.selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $46 million to $445 million in 2018 from $399 million in 2017. this increase was mainly due to an increase in employee compensation and professional consulting fees.amortization of intangibles. amortization expense for 2018 was comparable to 2017. transaction and integration-related costs. transaction and integration-related costs were $33 million in 2018 as compared to $29 million in 2017. the transaction and integration-related costs primarily consisted of integration-related consulting fees, severance benefits provided in conjunction with acquisition and reorganization charges.33table of contentsinterest expense. interest expense decreased by $33 million to $126 million in 2018 from $159 million in 2017, primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. the lower average debt balance in 2018 was mainly due to the redemption of the 2023 notes in may 2018 and the 2021 notes in february 2018. see "liquidity and capital resources—debt" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.other income, net. other income, net increased by $37 million to $52 million in 2018 from $15 million in 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, an increase in interest income of $13 million, a net gain of $6 million recognized on the redemption of the 2021 notes and an increase in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $6 million.income taxes. the effective income tax rate was an expense of 22% in 2018 as compared to a benefit of 24% in 2017. the effective tax rate in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017, primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. in addition, the u.s. corporate income tax rate was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. the effective income tax rate in 2018 was above the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state and foreign taxes. olefins segmentnet sales. net sales decreased by $32 million, or 2%, to $2,019 million in 2018 from $2,051 million in 2017. the decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes for styrene as a result of a planned turnaround in the second quarter of 2018 and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene and higher sales prices for styrene, as compared to 2017. average sales prices for the olefins segment decreased by 1% in 2018 as compared to 2017, while average sales volumes in 2018 were consistent with 2017.income from operations. income from operations was $573 million in 2018 as compared to $655 million in 2017. the decrease was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher ethane feedstock costs and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes. vinyls segmentnet sales. net sales increased by $626 million, or 10%, to $6,616 million in 2018 from $5,990 million in 2017. this increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for pvc resin as compared to 2017. average sales volumes increased by 4% in 2018, as compared to 2017, and average sales prices increased by 7% in 2018 as compared to 2017.income from operations. income from operations was $913 million in 2018 as compared to $639 million in 2017. this increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs, improved operating rates and lower costs associated with planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, as compared to 2017.2017 compared with 2016net sales. net sales increased by $2,965 million, or 58%, to $8,041 million in 2017 from $5,076 million in 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales volume contributed by axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. overall sales volumes increased by 46% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales contributed by axiall. average sales prices for 2017 increased by 12% as compared to 2016.gross profit. gross profit margin percentage increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2016. the gross profit margin for 2017 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products and higher sales volumes for caustic soda, chlorine and pvc resin contributed primarily by axiall, as compared to 2016. these increases were offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages and a proportionately larger sales volume for the vinyls segment, for which industry margins in 2017 and 2016 were lower as compared to the olefins industry.selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $141 million, or 55%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily because a full year of axiall's expenses were included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016 and an increase in employee compensation.amortization of intangibles. amortization of intangibles are comprised of amortization expense for customer relationships, trade name and other intangible assets. the amortization expense increased by $70 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, because a full year of expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the axiall merger was included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016.34table of contentstransaction and integration-related costs. transaction and integration-related costs were $29 million in 2017 as compared to $104 million in 2016. transaction and integration-related costs were $75 million lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 predominantly because significant transaction and integration-related costs were incurred at the time of the axiall merger in 2016. the transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former axiall employees in conjunction with the axiall merger and integration costs and consulting fees related to the axiall merger. the transaction and integration-related costs in 2016 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former axiall executives in conjunction with the axiall merger, including the conversion of axiall restricted stock units into our restricted stock units, transitional service expenses for certain former axiall employees, retention agreement costs and consulting and professional fees related to the axiall merger.interest expense. interest expense increased by $80 million to $159 million in 2017 from $79 million in 2016, primarily as a result of higher average debt outstanding for the year as well as decreased capitalized interest on major capital projects in 2017 as compared to 2016. the debt balance increased in august 2016 to finance the axiall merger. see "liquidity and capital resources—debt" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.other income, net. other income, net decreased by $39 million to $15 million in 2017 from $54 million in 2016. the decrease was mainly attributable to the realized gain in 2016 of $49 million from the previously held common stock of axiall.income taxes. the effective income tax rate was a benefit of 24% in 2017 as compared to an expense of 25% in 2016. the effective income tax rate for 2017 was below the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the $591 million income tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by a one-time u.s. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of our post-1986 foreign earnings as part of the tax act, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign earnings rate differential and foreign withholding tax related to such earnings. the effective income tax rate for 2016 was below the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed, change in state apportionment and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the axiall merger.olefins segmentnet sales. net sales increased by $157 million, or 8%, to $2,051 million in 2017 from $1,894 million in 2016, mainly due to higher sales prices for our major products compared to the prior year. average sales prices for the olefins segment increased by 9% in 2017 as compared to 2016, while average sales volumes decreased by 1% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower polyethylene sales.income from operations. income from operations was $655 million in 2017 as compared to $558 million in 2016. this increase was mainly attributable to higher olefins integrated product margins, primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products, higher operating rates and lower costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages as compared to the prior year. these increases were partially offset by higher energy costs. income from operations for 2016 was negatively impacted by the planned turnaround and expansion of the lake charles petro 1 ethylene unit along with other unplanned outages. trading activity for 2017 resulted in a loss of $4 million as compared to a gain of $20 million for 2016.vinyls segmentnet sales. net sales increased by $2,808 million, or 88%, to $5,990 million in 2017 from $3,182 million in 2016. this increase was mainly attributable to higher sales volume contributed primarily by axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. average sales volumes increased by 74% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily because a full year of axiall's operations was included in 2017 as compared to only four months of axiall's operations included in 2016. average sales prices for the vinyls segment increased by 14% in 2017 as compared to 2016.income from operations. income from operations was $639 million in 2017 as compared to $176 million in 2016. this increase was mainly attributable to earnings contributed by axiall and higher sales prices and volumes for our major products. these increases were partially offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with the planned turnaround and expansion at the calvert city facility and other turnarounds and unplanned outages in addition to higher energy costs in 2017, as compared to 2016.35table of contentscash flowsoperating activitiesoperating activities provided cash of $1,409 million in 2018 compared to cash provided of $1,528 million in 2017. the $119 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by an increase in income from operations in 2018 and lower income taxes for 2018 as a result of the tax act, as compared to 2017. income from operations increased by $183 million in 2018, as compared to the prior year 2017. the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of higher sales price and volume for caustic soda partially offset by higher feedstock costs. changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, used cash of $290 million in 2018, compared to $155 million of cash provided in 2017, an unfavorable change of $445 million. the change was mainly driven by unfavorable changes in inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. unfavorable changes in inventories were primarily the result of higher feedstock costs in 2018, as compared to 2017, and the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the timing of purchases and payments to suppliers as well as due to a lower income tax accrual as a result of the lower tax rate under the tax act.operating activities provided cash of $1,528 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $867 million in 2016. the $661 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in income from operations and a decrease in working capital requirements. income from operations increased by $642 million in 2017, as compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of higher sales prices, resulting in a higher margin, as well as higher earnings contributed by axiall. changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $155 million in 2017, compared to $59 million of cash provided in 2016, a favorable change of $96 million. the favorable change was mainly due to a decrease in cash usage in 2017 of $141 million resulting from higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in cash usage of $90 million, as compared to 2016.investing activitiesnet cash used for investing activities

equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the credit agreement and our long-term financing.on january 2, 2019, we acquired nakan and paid approximately $250 million as the purchase price.on july 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on july 24, 2023. see "liquidity and capital resources—debt—credit agreement" for more information.in november 2014, our board of directors authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program (the "2014 program"). in november 2015, our board of directors approved the expansion of the 2014 program by an additional $150 million. in august 2018, our board of directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 program by an additional $150 million. as of december 31,

sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. funding of any potential large expansions or potential acquisitions would likely necessitate and therefore depend on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. we may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets.cash and cash equivalentsas of december 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $753 million. in addition, we have the credit agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under "debt" below.debtas of december 31, 2018, our indebtedness, including the current portion, totaled $2,668 million. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. defined terms used in this section have the definitions assigned to such terms in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k. our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the credit agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.credit agreementon july 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on july 24, 2023 (the "credit agreement") and, in connection therewith, terminated the existing $1 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on august 23, 2021 (the "prior credit agreement"). the

8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 39table of contents4.625% senior notes due 2021 and 4.875% senior notes due 2023in september 2016, we completed offers to exchange (the "axiall exchange offers") any and all of the $688 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% subsidiary 2021 senior notes and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% subsidiary 2023 senior notes (together with the 4.625% subsidiary 2021 senior notes, the "subsidiary notes") issued by axiall for new senior notes issued by us having the same maturity and interest rates as the subsidiary notes. pursuant to the axiall exchange offers, $625 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% subsidiary 2021 senior notes and $434 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% subsidiary 2021 senior notes were exchanged for an identical amount of 4.625% westlake 2021 senior notes and 4.875% westlake 2021 senior notes, respectively, leaving outstanding $63 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% subsidiary 2021 senior notes and $16 million aggregate amount of 4.875% subsidiary 2021 notes. in december 2017, we delivered notices for the optional redemption of all of the outstanding 4.625% westlake 2021 senior notes and 4.625% subsidiary 2021 senior notes (collectively, the "2021 notes"). the 2021 notes were redeemed on february 15, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 102.313% of the principal amount of the 2021 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2021 notes to the redemption date. in march 2018, we delivered notices for the optional redemption of all of the outstanding westlake 4.875% senior notes due 2023 and 4.875% subsidiary notes due 2023 (collectively, the "2023 notes"). the 2023 notes were redeemed on may 15, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 notes to the redemption date.revenue bondsin december 1997, we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu, louisiana. the public trust issued $11 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. the interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was 1.85% and 1.73%, respectively.the indenture governing the 3.60% 2026 senior notes, the 5.0% 2046 senior notes, the 3.60% 2022 senior notes and the 4.375% 2047 senior notes contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt covenants. westlake chemical partners lp credit arrangementsour subsidiary, westlake chemical finance corporation, is the lender party to a $600 million revolving credit facility with westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners"), originally entered into on april 29, 2015. the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on april 29, 2021. borrowings under the revolver bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on westlake partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. westlake partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. as of december 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $254 million and bore interest at the libor rate plus 2.0%.our subsidiary, westlake polymers llp, is the administrative agent to a $600 million revolving credit facility with opco. the revolving credit facility was amended on september 25, 2018 to extend the maturity date from august 2019 to september 2023 and to revise the applicable margin from 3.0% to 2.0%. as of december 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $224 million and bore interest at the libor rate plus 2.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.we consolidate westlake partners and opco for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. as such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and westlake partners and opco are eliminated upon consolidation.contractual obligations and commercial commitmentsin addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2018 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, capital leases, pension benefits funding, post-retirement healthcare benefits, purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter. the amounts do not include deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule.40table of contents  payment due by period  total 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 thereafter             (dollars in millions)contractual

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including a minimum quantity and price. we are party to various obligations to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various feedstock, utilities, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage, pipeline usage and logistic support, in each case in the ordinary course of our business, as well as various purchase commitments for our capital projects. the amounts shown in the table above reflect our estimates based on the contractual quantities and the prices in effect under contractual agreements as of december 31, 2018.interest payments. interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at december 31, 2018.asset retirement obligations. this includes the estimated costs and timing of payments to satisfy our recognized asset retirement obligations. investment in lacc. this includes our portion of the forecasted

credit issued in connection with the $11 million tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and (2) other letters of credit totaling $26 million issued primarily to support commercial obligations and obligations under our insurance programs, including workers' compensation claims.uncertain income tax positions. we have recognized a liability for our uncertain income tax positions of approximately $12 million as of december 31, 2018. we do not believe we are likely to pay any material amounts during the year ending december 31, 2019. the ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are therefore excluded from the contractual obligations table above.off-balance sheet arrangementsnone.critical accounting policiescritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.41table of contentswe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with gaap. our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, accruals for long-term employee benefits, accounts receivable, income taxes and environmental and legal obligations. inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k. we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.long-lived assets. key estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. such estimates could be significantly modified. the carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the united states and world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions.we evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from one to 40 years. depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $641 million, $601 million and $378 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation or amortization charges would be accelerated.we defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit. total costs deferred on turnarounds were $79 million, $47 million and $77 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. amortization in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of previously deferred turnaround costs was $39 million, $30 million and $22 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, deferred turnaround costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $144 million. expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.additional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k.fair value estimates. we develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities, derivative instruments and pension plan assets. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. at december 31, 2018, our recorded goodwill was $1,002 million, which was associated with the acquisition of axiall, our specialty pvc pipe business and our longview facilities. in addition, we record all derivative instruments, pension plan assets and certain marketable securities at fair value. the fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market-based inputs. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.42table of contentsbusiness combinations and intangible assets including goodwill. we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the same period's financial statements, including the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. the application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. we perform our annual impairment assessment for the olefins and vinyls reporting units in october and april, respectively. we may elect to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment analysis is required. the qualitative assessment considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors related to raw materials and labor, current and projected financial performance, changes in management or strategy, and market capitalization. alternatively, we may unconditionally elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in any period. we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for both of our segments' reporting units during 2018 and concluded that quantitative impairment test was not required. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or conclude, based on the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment analysis is performed. the quantitative analysis compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. the fair values of the reporting units are calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. the discounted cash flow projections are based on a forecast to reflect the cyclicality of the business. the forecast is based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and financial performance of the market. the future cash flows are discounted to present value using an applicable discount rate. the significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of ebitda a willing buyer is likely to pay. even if the fair values of the reporting units decreased by 10% from the fair values determined in the most recent quantitative tests performed during 2017, the carrying values of the reporting units would not have exceeded their fair values. see item 1a, "risk factors—if our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant."the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.long-term employee benefit costs. our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits, are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is our responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties. it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and, if necessary, adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors.accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match, for each employee, that estimated cost to the period worked. to accomplish this, we rely extensively on advice from actuaries, and we make assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded. changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts. one of the more significant assumptions relates to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations. at december 31, 2018, the projected pension benefit obligations for u.s. and non-u.s. plans were calculated using assumed weighted average discount rates of 4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. the discount rates were determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. as a result of the funding relief provided by the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2015, no minimum funding requirements are expected during 2019 for the u.s. pension plans. additional information on the 2019 funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k.43table of contentsthe following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligation of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:  2018  u.s. plans non-u.s. plans       (dollars in millions)projected benefit obligation, end of year $648 $136discount rate increases by 100 basis points (68) (19)discount rate decreases by 100 basis points 81 24a one-percentage point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare trend rates would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.income taxes. we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.environmental and legal obligations. we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings. we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form 10-k.asset retirement obligations. we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. initially, the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. the liability is recorded at its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. we have conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of our manufacturing facilities. we also have conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period. recent accounting pronouncementssee note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskcommodity price riska substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle. we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies. our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable. we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products. based on our open derivative positions at december 31, 2018, a hypothetical $0.10 increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before income taxes by $17 million. 44table of contentsinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt. at december 31, 2018, we had $2,704 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt. we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced. if interest rates were 1% higher at the time of refinancing, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $27 million. also, at december 31, 2018, we had $11 million principal amount of variable rate debt outstanding, which represents the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds. we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt, but we may do so in the future. the average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of $11 million as of december 31, 2018 was 1.85%. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in the interest expense. foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our international operations. however, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates caused by our international operations has not had a material impact on our overall operating results. we may engage in activities to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in certain instances through the use of currency exchange derivative instruments, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps or spot purchases. a forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified currencies at a stated exchange rate on a stated date. a cross-currency swap obligates us to make periodic payments in the local currency and receive periodic payments in our functional currency based on the notional amount of the instrument. in january 2018, we entered into hedging arrangements designated as net investment hedges with an aggregate notional value of 220 million euros to reduce the volatility in stockholders' equity from changes in currency exchange rates associated with our net investments in foreign operations. the arrangement is scheduled to mature in 2026.45table of contentsitem 8. financial statements and supplementary

reportingthe management of westlake chemical corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. westlake's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.westlake management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control—integrated framework (2013). based on its assessment, westlake's management has concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2018 based on those criteria.pricewaterhousecoopers llp, the independent

corporation and its subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of

principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the coso.basis for opinionsthe company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob") and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.definition and limitations of internal control over financial reportinga company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.47table of contentsbecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/pricewaterhousecoopers llphouston, texas    february 20, 2019we have served as the company's auditor since 1986, which includes periods before the company became subject

and per share data)1. description of business and significant accounting policiesdescription of businesswestlake chemical corporation (the "company") operates as an integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. these products include some of the most widely used chemicals in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. the company's customers range from large chemical processors and plastics fabricators to small construction contractors, municipalities and supply warehouses primarily throughout north america and europe. the petrochemical industry is subject to price fluctuations and volatile feedstock pricing typical of a commodity-based industry, the effects of which may not be immediately passed along to customers.acquisition of axiall corporationon august 31, 2016, the company completed the acquisition of axiall corporation ("axiall") for $33.00 per share in an all-cash transaction (the "axiall merger").westlake chemical partners lpin 2014, the company formed westlake chemical partners lp ("westlake partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. westlake partners' assets consist of a limited partner interest in westlake chemical opco lp ("opco"), as well as the general partner interest in opco. opco's assets include two ethylene production facilities at the company's lake charles, louisiana site, one ethylene production facility at the company's calvert city, kentucky site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from mont belvieu, texas to the company's longview, texas site. as of december 31, 2018, the company held an 81.7% limited partner interest in opco and a controlling interest in westlake partners. the operations of westlake partners are consolidated in the company's financial statements.principles of consolidationthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and subsidiaries in which the company directly or indirectly owns more than a 50% voting interest and exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which the company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. investments in majority-owned companies where the company does not exercise control and investments in nonconsolidated affiliates (20%-50% owned companies, joint ventures and partnerships) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. undistributed earnings from joint ventures included in retained earnings were immaterial as of december 31, 2018. all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. certain reclassifications have been made to the prior-year financial statements to conform to the current-year presentation.noncontrolling interests represent the direct equity interests held by investors in the company's consolidated subsidiaries, westlake partners, taiwan chlorine industries, ltd. and suzhou huasu plastics co., ltd. cash and cash equivalentscash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.concentration of credit riskfinancial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentration of risk consist principally of trade receivables from customers engaged in manufacturing polyethylene products, polyvinyl chloride ("pvc") products and pvc pipe products. the company performs periodic credit evaluations of the customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. the company maintains allowances for potential losses.54table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)allowance for doubtful accountsthe determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimation of the amount of accounts receivable that the company believes are unlikely to be collected. estimating this amount requires analysis of the financial strength of the company's customers, the use of historical experience, the company's accounts receivable aged trial balance, and specific collectibility analysis. the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly. past due balances over 90 days and high risk accounts as determined by the analysis of financial strength of customers are reviewed individually for collectibility.inventoriesinventories primarily include product, material and supplies. inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("fifo") or average method. property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. cost includes expenditures for improvements and betterments that extend the useful lives of the assets and interest capitalized on significant capital projects. capitalized interest was $7, $4 and $10 for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. gains and losses on the disposition or retirement of fixed assets are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations when the assets are sold or retired.the accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations requires the recording of liabilities equal to the fair value of asset retirement obligations and corresponding additional asset costs, when there is a legal asset retirement obligation as a result of existing or enacted law, statute or contract. depreciation is provided by utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:classification yearsbuildings and improvements 40plant and equipment 10-25other 3-15impairment of long-lived assetsthe accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets requires that the company review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.impairment of goodwill and intangible assetsthe accounting guidance requires that goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. the company performed its annual impairment tests for the olefins and vinyls segments' goodwill in october 2018 and april 2018, respectively, and the impairment tests indicated that the recorded goodwill was not impaired. there has been no impairment of the olefins or vinyls segments' goodwill since the goodwill was initially recorded. other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance. see note 7 for more information on the company's annual goodwill impairment tests.other assets, netother assets, net include turnaround costs, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, restricted cash, deferred charges and other long-term assets.55table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)the company accounts for turnaround costs under the deferral method. turnarounds are the scheduled and required shutdowns of specific operating units in order to perform planned major maintenance activities. the costs related to the significant overhaul and refurbishment activities include maintenance materials, parts and direct labor costs. the costs of the turnaround are deferred when incurred at the time of the turnaround and amortized (within depreciation and amortization) on a straight-line basis until the next planned turnaround, which ranges from three to six years. deferred turnaround costs are presented as a component of other assets, net. the cash outflows related to these costs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.business combinationsthe company records business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. under the acquisition method of accounting, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. changes in the estimated fair values of net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will adjust the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. measurement period adjustments are reflected in the period in which they occur.income taxesthe company utilizes the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.on december 22, 2017, the united states ("u.s.") tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was signed into law. the tax act, among other changes, reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, and also required a one-time deemed repatriation of foreign earnings at specified rates. the company provisionally recognized a $591 income tax benefit in the 2017 consolidated financial statements that was primarily comprised of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by a one-time u.s. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the company's post-1986 foreign earnings. the company did not record any material measurement period adjustment in 2018. for additional information, see note 14.as a result of the tax act, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") concluded that global intangible low-taxed income tax ("gilti tax") can be recognized in the financial statements, no later than december 22, 2018, per an accounting policy choice, by: (1) recording a period cost (permanent item) or (2) providing deferred income taxes stemming from certain basis differences that are expected to result in gilti tax. the company elected to record gilti tax as a period cost. the gilti tax recognized in 2018 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.foreign currency translationassets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to u.s. dollars at the exchange rate as of the end of the year. statement of operations items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity.revenue recognitionrevenue is recognized when the company transfers control of inventories to its customers. amounts recognized as revenues reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those inventories. provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are incorporated in the estimate of variable consideration and reflected as reduction to revenue in the same period as the related sales.control of inventories generally transfers upon shipment for domestic sales. the company excludes taxes collected on behalf of customers from the estimated contract price. for export contracts, the point at which control passes to the customer varies depending on the terms specified in the customer contract. 56table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)the company generally invoices customers and recognizes revenue and accounts receivable upon transferring control of inventories. in limited circumstances, the company transfers control of inventories shortly before it has an unconditional right to receive consideration, resulting in recognition of contract assets. the company also receives advance payments from certain customers, resulting in recognition of contract liabilities. contract assets and liabilities are generally settled within the period and are not material to the consolidated balance sheets.the company expenses sales commissions when incurred. these costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. the company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations because its contracts with customers (1) have an original expected duration of one year or less or (2) have only variable consideration that is calculated based on market prices at specified dates and is allocated to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations.prior to the adoption of asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606"), on january 1, 2018, the revenue was recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, products were delivered to the customer, the sales price was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured. for domestic contracts, title and risk of loss had passed to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts. for export contracts, the title and risk of loss had passed to customers at the time specified by each contract. transportation and freightamounts billed to customers for freight and handling costs on outbound shipments are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. transportation and freight costs incurred by the company on outbound shipments are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.price risk managementthe company recognizes derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in a derivative's fair value are currently recognized in earnings or comprehensive income, depending on the designation of the derivative. if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in comprehensive income and is recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings currently. the derivative instruments did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.asset retirement obligationsthe company has conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of the company's manufacturing facilities. the company recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. recognized asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. the liability is accreted to its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. as of december 31, 2018, the company had $8 and $20 of asset retirement obligations recorded as accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, the company had $3 and $18 of asset retirement obligations recorded as accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively. the company also has conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period. 57table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)environmental costsenvironmental costs relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on whether such costs provide future economic benefits. remediation liabilities are recognized when the costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. environmental liabilities in connection with properties that are sold or closed are realized upon such sale or closure, to the extent they are probable and estimable and not previously reserved. recognition of any joint and several liabilities is based upon the company's best estimate of its final pro rata share of the liability.use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from those estimates.recent accounting pronouncementsleases (asu no. 2016-02)in february 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update on a new lease standard that will supersede the existing lease guidance. the standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities related to long-term leases that are classified as operating leases under current guidance on its balance sheet. an asset would be recognized related to the right to use the underlying asset and a liability would be recognized related to the obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. the standard also requires expanded disclosures related to leases. the standard requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach and allows for the election of certain transition practical expedients. the accounting standards update allows for certain transition expedients for leases that commenced prior to the adoption of the new standard. under the optional transition expedients an entity is not required to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing lease contracts are or contain leases, (2) the classification of leases as operating or capital leases or (3) whether any initial direct costs qualify for capitalization under the new accounting standard. these expedients are required to be elected as a group. the accounting standards update also allows the use of hindsight to determine the lease term when considering lease renewal or termination options.during 2018, the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance that provides an optional transition method which allows entities to continue applying the existing lease guidance in the comparative periods and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. the fasb also issued an accounting standards update that allows entities to apply their existing policy for accounting for land easements that exist as of, or expired before, the effective date of the new lease standard.the accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018. the accounting standard is expected to result in the recognition of material right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.credit losses (asu no. 2016-13)in june 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update providing new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. the new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. the standard also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. the accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.58table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)intangibles - goodwill and other (asu no. 2017-04)in january 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill. the guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. the accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.fair value measurement (asu no. 2018-13)in august 2018, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. the amendments are effective beginning after december 15, 2019. an entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until the effective date. most amendments should be applied retrospectively, but certain amendments will be applied prospectively. the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the standard on the company's fair value disclosures. however, the standard is not expected to have an impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.recently adopted accounting standardsrevenue from contracts with customers (asu no. 2014-09)in may 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standards update on a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes virtually all previously issued revenue recognition guidance. the new accounting guidance creates a framework by which an entity will allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. under the new standard, entities are required to use judgment and make estimates, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and determining when an entity satisfies its performance obligations. the standard allows for "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative catch-up as of the current period. the company adopted asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers , effective january 1, 2018. the company applied the modified retrospective transition method to all contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. periods prior to january 1, 2018 were not adjusted and are reported under the accounting standards that were in place during those periods. the cumulative effects of changes to the company's consolidated january 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of this accounting standard were immaterial.the impact of asc 606 adoption on the financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared with the guidance that was in effect prior to january 1, 2018 was immaterial.asc 606 requires disclosure of disaggregated revenue into categories that depict the nature of how the company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. the company discloses revenues by product and segment in note 20. recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (asu no. 2016-01)in january 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update making certain changes principally to the current guidance for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. among other things, the guidance (1) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) allows entities to elect to measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes (changes in the basis of these equity investments to be reported in net income); (3) requires an entity that has elected the fair value option for financial liabilities to recognize changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk separately in other comprehensive income; (4) clarified current guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities; and (5) requires specific disclosure pertaining to financial assets and financial liabilities in the financial statements. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 59table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)cash flows (asu no. 2016-15)in august 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update providing new guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments including debt extinguishment costs, debt prepayment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees in the statement of cash flows. this update is required to be applied using the retrospective transition method to each period presented unless it is impracticable to be applied retrospectively. in such situation, this guidance is to be applied prospectively. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.cash flows (asu no. 2016-18)in november 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to clarify certain existing principles in accounting standards codification 230, cash flows, including providing additional guidance related to transfers between cash and restricted cash and how entities present, in their statement of cash flows, the cash receipts and cash payments that directly affect the restricted cash accounts. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018. upon adoption, the company retrospectively adjusted its financial statements to reflect restricted cash in the beginning and ending cash and restricted cash balances within the statements of cash flows. as a result of this retrospective adoption and reclassification of restricted cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2017 has been adjusted to $6 from the originally reported $160. net cash provided by financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2016 has been adjusted to $1,687 from the originally reported $1,533. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 has been adjusted to $1,528 from the originally reported $1,538. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 has been adjusted to $867 from the originally reported $834.business combinations (asu no. 2017-01)in january 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. the guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. the guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in asc 606. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted the accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.other income - gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets (asu no. 2017-05) in february 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to clarify the scope of guidance related to other income—gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets, and to add guidance for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. the new guidance clarifies that an in substance nonfinancial asset is an asset or group of assets for which substantially all of the fair value consists of nonfinancial assets and the group or subsidiary is not a business. the guidance also outlines that when an entity transfers its controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, but retains a noncontrolling interest, it will measure the retained interest at fair value resulting in full gain or loss recognition upon sale of the controlling interest. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.60table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)compensation - retirement benefits (asu no. 2017-07)in march 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the new guidance requires employers to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost and report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. the amendments also allow only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the adoption resulted in retrospective reclassification of immaterial amounts from cost of sales to other income, net.compensation - stock compensation (asu no. 2017-09)in may 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to provide clarity and reduce both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in topic 718, compensation-stock compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. the amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require the application of modification accounting in topic 718. essentially, an entity will not have to account for the effects of a modification if: (1) the fair value of the modified award is the same immediately before and after the modification; (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same immediately before and after the modification; and (3) the classification of the modified award as either an equity instrument or liability instrument is the same immediately before and after the modification. this update is to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. the accounting standard became effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.derivatives and hedging - targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities (asu no. 2017-12)in august 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to improve financial reporting of hedging relationships, to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in the financial statements and to simplify application of hedge accounting guidance. the accounting standard eliminates certain hedge effectiveness measurement and reporting requirements and expands the types of permissible hedging strategies. the accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early application is permitted in any interim period after issuance, to be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year. the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. income statement - reporting comprehensive income (asu no. 2018-02)in february 2018, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to (1) allow reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax act; and (2) require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. certain tax effects become stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income when deferred tax balances originally recorded at the historical income tax rate are adjusted in income from continuing operations based on the lower, newly-enacted income tax rate. the accounting standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. the company adopted the accounting standard effective october 1, 2018 and reclassified $13 of stranded tax effects relating to its pension benefits liability and cumulative effect of foreign exchange from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.intangibles - goodwill and other (asu no. 2018-15)in august 2018, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. the amendments should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. the company adopted the standard on october 1, 2018, prospectively, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.61table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)2. acquisitionsaxiall corporationon august 31, 2016, the company completed its acquisition of, and acquired all the remaining equity interest in, axiall, a delaware corporation. prior to the acquisition, the company held 3.1 million shares in axiall. the combined company is the third-largest global chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest global pvc producer. the company's management believes that this strategic acquisition will enhance its strategy of integration and will further strengthen its role in the north american markets.axiall produces a highly integrated chain of chlor-alkali and derivative products, including chlorine, caustic soda, vinyl chloride monomer ("vcm"), pvc resin, pvc compounds and chlorinated derivative products. axiall also manufactures and sells building products, including siding, trim, mouldings, pipe and pipe fittings. total consideration transferred for the axiall merger was $2,540. the axiall merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the company's vinyls segment.for the year ended december 31, 2016, the company recognized $104 of transaction and integration-related costs. this included acquisition-related costs of $49 for advisory, consulting and professional fees and other expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016. transaction and integration-related costs also included $55 during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the settlement of axiall share-based awards, retention agreement costs and severance benefits provided to former axiall employees in connection with the axiall merger.the following table summarizes the consideration transferred and the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. the allocation of the consideration transferred is based on management's estimates, judgments and assumptions. when determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of the acquiree, management made significant estimates, judgments and assumptions. management estimated that consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. therefore, goodwill of $942 was recorded. the goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to synergies related to the company's vinyls integration strategy that are expected to arise from the axiall merger. all of the goodwill is assigned to the company's vinyls segment. as a portion of the goodwill arising from the axiall merger is attributable to foreign operations, there will be a continuing foreign currency impact to goodwill in the consolidated financial statements.  final purchase

attributable to pre-combination service includes the ratio of the pre-combination service performed to the original service period of the axiall restricted share units and options, including related dividend equivalent rights.(3)prior to the axiall merger, the company owned 3.1 million shares in axiall. the investment in axiall was carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. the company recognized a $49 gain for the investment in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations upon gaining control.the acquired business contributed net sales and net loss of $976 and $96, respectively, to the company for the period from august 31, 2016 to december 31, 2016. the net loss for the period from august 31, 2016 to december 31, 2016 included integration-related costs and the negative impact of selling higher cost axiall inventory recorded at fair value. the following

period prior to the closing of the axiall merger for (1) divestitures; (2) restructuring; and (3) legal and settlement claims, net, of $27, $23 and $23, respectively. these amounts have not been eliminated for pro forma results because they do not relate to nonrecurring transaction-specific costs related to the axiall merger. the pro forma amounts above have been calculated after applying the company's accounting policies and adjusting the axiall results to reflect (1) the increase to depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from january 1, 2015; (2) the elimination of net sales and cost of sales between the company and axiall; (3) additional pension service costs; (4) amortization of debt premium and accretion of asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities as part of the company's adjustments to fair value; (5) incremental interest expense that would have been incurred assuming the financing arrangements entered into by the company and the repayment of a portion of axiall's outstanding debt had occurred on january 1, 2015; (6) the elimination of transaction-related costs; and (7) an adjustment to tax-effect the aforementioned pro forma adjustments using an estimated aggregate statutory income tax rate of the jurisdictions to which the above adjustments relate. the pro forma amounts do not include any potential synergies, cost savings or other expected benefits of the axiall merger, are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of results that would have been achieved if the axiall merger had occurred as of january 1, 2015 or of future operating performance.63table of

optional redemption by the authority upon the direction of the company if certain events have occurred in connection with the operation of the projects for which the bond proceeds may be used, including if the company has determined that the continued operation of any material portion of the projects would be impracticable, uneconomical or undesirable for any reason.69table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)in september 2017, the company directed the authority to optionally redeem in full the $250 aggregate principal amount of the 6 ¾% 2032 go zone bonds on november 1, 2017. in connection with the redemption of the 6 ¾% 2032 go zone bonds, the authority was required to cause the go zone bonds trustee to surrender the 6 ¾% 2032 go zone senior notes to the senior notes trustee for cancellation. the 6 ¾% 2032 go zone bonds were redeemed and the 6 ¾% 2032 go zone senior notes were cancelled on november 1, 2017.in november 2017, the authority completed the remarketing of $250 aggregate principal amount of 3.50% tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds due november 1, 2032 (the "3.50% 2032 go zone bonds"). in connection with the remarketing of the 3.50% 2032 go zone bonds, the company issued $250 of the 3.50% 2032 senior notes. the 3.50% 2032 go zone bonds are subject to optional redemption by the authority upon the direction of the company at any time on or after november 1, 2027, for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. the indenture governing the 3.50% 2032 senior notes contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict the company and certain of the company's subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all of substantially all of its assets.in connection with each offering of the tax-exempt bonds, the company entered into a loan agreement with the authority pursuant to which the company agreed to pay all of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds and certain other amounts to the authority. the net proceeds from the offerings were loaned by the authority to the company. the company used the proceeds to expand, refurbish and maintain certain of its facilities in the louisiana parishes of calcasieu and ascension. the bonds are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. as of december 31, 2018, the company had drawn all proceeds from the tax-exempt bonds. in connection with each such offering of the tax-exempt bonds, the company issued senior notes under a base indenture and supplemental indenture to collateralize its obligations under the loan agreement relating to such tax-exempt bonds (collectively, the "tax-exempt bond related senior notes").the indentures governing the tax-exempt bond related senior notes excluding the 3.5% 2032 go zone refunding senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default. accordingly, these agreements generally impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the company. these restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets. however, the effectiveness of certain of these restrictions is currently suspended because the tax-exempt bond related senior notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the most significant of these provisions, if it were currently effective, would restrict the company from incurring additional debt, except specified permitted debt (including borrowings under its credit facility), when the company's fixed charge coverage ratio is below 2.0:1. these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including, without limitation, an exception for the payment of the company's regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.10 per share. if the restrictions were currently effective, distributions in excess of $100 would not be allowed unless, after giving pro forma effect to the distribution, the company's fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 2.0:1 and such payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january 13, 2006, is less than the sum of 50% of the company's consolidated net income for the period from october 1, 2003 to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed, plus 100% of net cash proceeds received after october 1, 2003 as a contribution to the company's common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities, plus several other adjustments.revenue bondsin december 1997, the company entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu, louisiana. the public trust issued $11 principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance the company's construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for

part-time employees, whereby eligible employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their annual eligible compensation, subject to an annual plan limit in line with the annual elective contribution limit as determined by the internal revenue service. during 2017, the axiall savings plans were merged into the company's defined contribution plan. the company matches its employee's contribution up to a certain percentage of such employee's compensation, per the terms of the plan. the company may, at its discretion and per the terms of the plan, make an additional non-matching contribution in an amount as the board of directors may determine. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the company recorded approximately $21, $23 and $11, respectively, to expense for these contributions. further, within the plan, the company also makes an annual retirement contribution to substantially all employees of certain subsidiaries. the company's contributions to the plan are

periodically adjusted. the company recognizes the years of service prior to the company's acquisition of the subsidiary's facilities for purposes of determining vesting, eligibility and benefit levels for certain employees of the subsidiary and for determining vesting and eligibility for certain other employees of the subsidiary. the measurement date for these plans is december 31.in connection

a portion of the assets and obligations of the defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees was transferred to the defined benefit pension plan for wage employees, which was subsequently renamed the westlake defined benefit plan. the remaining portion of the assets and obligations of the defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees was terminated through an annuity purchase transaction. the other post-retirement benefit plans are unfunded and provide medical and life insurance benefits for certain employees and their dependents.non-u.s. plansthe company has defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees associated with the company's operations. these pension plans are closed to new participants and are for employees who commenced employment

portions of their projected benefit obligations through the purchase of annuities and lump sum payments to certain participants. in conjunction with the settlement, the company also remeasured the pension obligations and plan assets of the affected plans, resulting in a $26 increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before tax and a corresponding decrease in net pension liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. the company recognized a $14 one-time settlement gain in other income, net, which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).75table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)the weighted-average

in the westlake defined benefit plan. the company's overall investment strategy for these pension plan assets is to achieve a balance between moderate income generation and capital appreciation. the investment strategy includes a mix of approximately 60% of investments for long-term growth, and 40% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types. these pension funds' investment policies target asset allocations from approximately 60% equity securities and 40% fixed income securities in order to pursue a balance between moderate income generation and capital appreciation.equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies located in the u.s. and international developed and emerging markets stocks. fixed income securities are comprised of investment and non-investment grade bonds, including u.s. treasuries and u.s. and non-u.s. corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries. each pension fund investment policy allows a discretionary range in various asset classes within the asset allocation model of up to 10%. the company does not believe that there are significant concentrations of risk in the pension plan assets due to its strategy of asset diversification. at december 31, 2018, plan assets did not include direct ownership of the company's common stock.under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, inputs used to measure fair value are classified in one of three levels:level 1: quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2: observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.level 3: unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.76table of contents    westlake chemical

certain individuals who have agreed to become the company's employees, are eligible for awards. shares of common stock may be issued as authorized in the 2013 plan. at the discretion of the administrator of the 2013 plan, employees and non-employee directors may be granted awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock units or cash awards (any of which may be a performance award). outstanding stock option awards have a 10-year term and vest (1) ratably on an annual basis over a three-year period or (2) at the end of a five-year period.

long-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt) at december 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized in the table below. the company's long-term debt instruments are publicly-traded. a market approach, based upon quotes from financial reporting services, is used to measure the fair value of the company's long-term debt. because the company's long-term debt instruments may not be actively traded, the inputs used to measure the fair value of the company's long-term debt are classified as level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.83table of contents    westlake chemical

they expire, but to the extent that the full benefit may not be realized, a valuation allowance has been recorded. the valuation allowance decreased by $9 in 2018 mostly as a result of a change to the foreign net operating losses carryforward.85table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)as result of the tax act, the company recognized an income tax benefit of $591 in the 2017 consolidated financial statements for items such as a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by a one-time u.s. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the company's post-1986 foreign earnings. the company did not record any material measurement period adjustment in 2018. the accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.in february 2018, the fasb issued an accounting standards update, income statement - reporting comprehensive income, to (1) allow reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax act; and (2) require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. certain tax effects become stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when deferred tax balances originally recorded at the historical income tax rate are adjusted in income from operations based on the lower, newly-enacted income tax rate. the company adopted the accounting standard effective october 1, 2018 and reclassified $13 of stranded tax effects relating to its pension benefits liability and cumulative effect of foreign exchange from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings.during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company made a policy election to record the impact of the accounting for gilti tax as a period cost. the gilti tax recognized in 2018 was not material

corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data)19. commitments and contingenciesthe company is involved in a number of legal and regulatory matters, principally environmental in nature, that are incidental to the normal conduct of its business, including lawsuits, investigations and claims. the outcome of these matters are inherently unpredictable. the company believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all known legal and regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements; however, under certain circumstances, if required to recognize costs in a specific period, when combined with other factors, outcomes with respect to such matters may be material to the company's consolidated statements of operations in such period. the company's assessment of the potential impact of environmental matters, in particular, is subject to uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation of such environmental matters, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. in addition, the impact of evolving claims and programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site reuse initiatives and state remediation programs creates further uncertainty of the ultimate resolution of these matters. the company anticipates that the resolution of many legal and regulatory matters, and in particular environmental matters, will occur over an extended period of time.environmental. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the company had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling approximately $54 and $49, respectively, most of which was classified as noncurrent liabilities. the company's assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments.calvert city proceedings. for several years, the environmental protection agency (the "epa") has been conducting remedial investigation and feasibility studies at the company's calvert city, kentucky facility pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 ("cercla"). as the current owner of the calvert city facility, the company was named by the epa as a potentially responsible party ("prp") along with goodrich corporation ("goodrich") and its successor-in-interest, polyone corporation ("polyone"). on november 30, 2017, the epa published a draft proposed plan, incorporating by reference an august 2015 draft remedial investigation ("ri") report, an october 2017 draft feasibility study ("fs") report and a new technical impracticability waiver document dated december 19, 2017. on june 18, 2018, the epa published an amendment to its proposed plan. the amended proposed plan describes a final remedy for the onshore portion of the site comprised of a containment wall, targeted treatment and supplemental hydraulic containment. the amended proposed plan also describes an interim approach to address the contamination under the river that would include recovery of any mobile contaminants by an extraction well along with further study of the extent of the contamination and potential treatment options. the epa's estimated cost of implementation is $107, with an estimated $1 to $3 in annual operation and maintenance ("o&m") costs. in september 2018, the epa published the record of decision ("rod") for the site, formally selecting the preferred final and interim remedies outlined in the amended proposed plan. in october 2018, epa issued special notice letters to the prps for the remedial design phase of work under the rod. the prps submitted a joint good faith offer in december 2018 indicating their intent to negotiate a remedial design agreed order on consent and capability to undertake the remedial design at the site. the company's allocation of liability for remedial or o&m costs, if any, will be determined by the outcome of the contractual dispute with goodrich/polyone, which is the subject of a pending arbitration proceeding as described below.in connection with the 1990 and 1997 acquisitions of the goodrich chemical manufacturing complex in calvert city, goodrich agreed to indemnify the company for any liabilities related to preexisting contamination at the complex. for its part, the company agreed to indemnify goodrich for post-closing contamination caused by the company's operations. the soil and groundwater at the complex, which does not include the company's nearby pvc facility, had been extensively contaminated by goodrich's operations. in 1993, goodrich spun off the predecessor of polyone, and that predecessor assumed goodrich's indemnification obligations relating to preexisting contamination. in 2003, litigation arose among the company, goodrich and polyone with respect to the allocation of the cost of remediating contamination at the site. the parties settled this litigation in december 2007 and the case was dismissed. in the settlement, the parties agreed that, among other things: (1) polyone would pay 100% of the costs (with specified exceptions), net of recoveries or credits from third parties, incurred with respect to environmental issues at the calvert city site from august 1, 2007 forward; and (2) either the company or polyone might, from time to time in the future (but not more than once every five years), institute an arbitration proceeding to adjust that percentage. in may 2017, polyone filed a demand for arbitration. in this proceeding, polyone seeks to readjust the percentage allocation of future costs and to recover approximately $10 from the company in reimbursement of previously paid remediation costs. the company has filed a cross demand for arbitration seeking unreimbursed remediation costs incurred during the relevant period. 90table of contents    westlake chemical corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements—(continued)(in millions of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) on july 10, 2018, polyone filed another action in the u.s. district court for the western district of kentucky, seeking for the court to issue an injunction against continued proceedings in the arbitration. on july 30, 2018, the court denied polyone's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. the arbitration hearing began in august 2018 and concluded in december 2018. a decision from the panel is anticipated in the second quarter of 2019.at this time, the company is not able to estimate the impact, if any, that the arbitration proceeding could have on the company's consolidated financial statements either in the current period or in later periods. any cash expenditures that the company might incur in the future with respect to the remediation of contamination at the calvert city complex would likely be spread out over an extended period. as a result, the company believes it is unlikely that any remediation costs allocable to it will be material in terms of expenditures made in any individual reporting period.environmental remediation: reasonably possible matters. the company's assessment of the potential impact of environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. as such, in addition to the amounts currently reserved, the company may be subject to reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters in the range of $65 to $130.other commitmentsthe company is obligated under various long-term and short-term noncancelable operating leases, primarily related to rail car leases and land. several of the leases provide for renewal terms and, in certain leases, purchase options. at december 31, 2018, future minimum lease commitments for operating lease obligations and capital lease obligations were as follows:  operating leases capital
